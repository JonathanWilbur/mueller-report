an interview ." 1 We additionally stated that "it is in the interest of the presidency and the public
for an interview to take place" and offered "numerous accommodations to aid the president's
preparation and avoid surprise." 2 After extensive discussions with the department of justice about
the special counsel's objective of securing the president's testimony, thes e accommodations
included the submissions of written questions to the president on certain Russia-related topics.
[^3]: We received the president's written responses in late November 2018. 4 In December 2018, we informed counsel of the insufficiency of those responses in several respects. 5 We noted, among
other things, that the president stated on more than 30 occasions that he "does not're call'or'remember'or have an'independent recollection"'of information called for by the questions. 6

Other answers were "incomplete or imprecise." 7 The written responses, we informed counsel, "demonstrate the inadequacy of the written format, as we hav e had no opportunity to ask follow-
up questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client's recollection
or clarify the extent or nature of his lack of recollection." 8 We again requested an in-person
interview, limited to certain topics, advising the president's counsel that " \[t\]his is the president's

the evidence we have gathered." 9 The president declined.
[^10]: recognizing that the president would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered
whether to issue a subpoena for his testimony. We viewed the written answers to be inadequate. But at that point, our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial
evidence for our report. We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation, against the anticipated benefits for our
investigation and report. As explained in Volume II, section H.B., we determined that the
substantial quantity of information we had obtained from other sources allowed us to draw relevant
factual conclusions on intent and credibility, which are often inferred from circumstantial evidence
and assessed without direct testimony from the subject of the investigation.

information, when you were informed, and the content of such discussion(s). response to question l, Parts (a) through (c)
I have no recollection of learning at the time that Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, or Jared
Kushner was considering participating in a meeting in June 2016 concerning potentially negative
information about Hillary Clinton. Nor do I recall learning during the campaign that the June 9, 2016 meeting had taken place, that the referenced emails existed. or that Donald J. Trump, Jr., had
other communications with Emin Agalarov or Robert Goldstone between June 3, 2016 and June
9, 2016. response to question I, Part (d)
 I have no independent recollection of what portion of these four days in June of2016 I spent in
 Trump Tower. This was one of many busy months during a fast-paced campaign, as the primary
 season was ending and we were preparing for the general election campaign. I am now aware that my campaign's calendar indicates that I was in New York City from June
[^6]: - 9, 2016. calendars kept in my Trump Tower office reflect that I had various calls and meetings
 scheduled for each of these days. While those calls and meetings may or may not actually have
 taken place, they do indicate that I was in Trump Tower during a portion of each of these working
 days, and I have no reason to doubt that I was. When I was in New York City, I stayed at my
 Trump Tower apartment. My Trump organization desk calendar also reflects that I was outside Trump Tower during
 portions of these days. The June 7, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to leave Trump Tower
 in the early evening for Westchester where I gave remarks after winning the California, New
 Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota republican primaries held that day. The June 8, 2016 calendar indicates a scheduled departure in late afternoon to attend a ceremony at my son's
 school. The June 9, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to attend midday meetings and a
 fundraising luncheon at the Four seasons Hotel. At this point, I do not remember on what dales
 these events occurred, but I do not currently have a reason to doubt that they took place as
 scheduled on my calendar. Widely available media reports, including television footage, also shed light on my activities
 during these days. For example, I am aware that my June 7, 2016 victory remarks at the Trump
national Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, New York, were recorded and published by the media. 1

remember winning those primaries and generally recall delivering remarks that evening. At this point in time, I do not remember whether I spoke or met with Donald Trump, Jr., Paul
Manafort, or Jared Kushner on June 9, 2016. My desk calendar indicates I was scheduled to meet
with Paul Manafort on the morning of June 9, but I do not recall if that meeting took place. It was
more than two years ago, at a time when I had many calls and interactions daily. ·
response to question I, Part (e)
I have no independent recollection of any communications I had with the Agalarov family or
anyone r understood to be a representative of the Agalarov family after June 3, 2016 and before
the end of the campaign. While preparing to respond to these questions, I have become aware of
written communications with the Agalarovs during the campaign that were sent, received, and
largely authored by my staff and which I understand have already been produced to you. In general, the documents include congratulatory letters on my campaign victories, emails about a
painting Emin and Aras Agalarov arranged to have delivered to Trump Tower as a birthday
present, and emails regarding delivery of a book written by Aras Agalarov. The documents reflect
that the deliveries were screened by the Secret service. response to question I, Part (t)
 I do not recall being aware during the campaign of communications between Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, or Jared Kushner and any member or representative of the Agalarov family, Robert
 Goldstone, Natalia Yeselnitskaya (whose name I was not familiar with), or anyone I understood
 to be a Russian official. response to question I, Part (g)
 In remarks I delivered the night I won the California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and
 South Dakota republican primaries, I said, "I am going to give a major speech on probably
 Monday of next week and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with
 the Clintons." In general, l expected to give a speech referencing the publicly available, negative
 information about the Clintons, including, for example, Mrs. Clinton's failed policies, the
 Clintons'use of the State department to further their interests and the interests of the Clinton
 foundation, Mrs. Clinton's improper use of a private server for State department business, the
 destruction of 33,000 emails on that server, and Mrs. Clinton's temperamental unsuitability for the
 office of president. In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that the campaign
 documents already produced to you reflect the drafting, evolution, and sources of information for
 the speech I expected to give "probably" on the Monday following my June 7, 2016 comments. These documents generally show that the text of the speech was initially drafted by campaign staff
with input from various outside advisors and was based on publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the book CUnton Cash by Peter Schweizer. The Pulse nightclub terrorist attack took place in the early morning hours of Sunday, June 12, 2016. In light of that tragedy, I gave a speech directed more specifically to national security and
terrorism than to the Clintons. That speech was delivered at the Saint Anselm college institute of
politics in manchester, New Hampshire, and, as reported, opened with the following:

This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a president, especially in these times of radical Islamic terrorism, she would be. Even her

former Secret service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president. There will

be plenty of oppo1tunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will

deliver that speech soon. But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing

threat of terrorism inside of our borders. I continued to speak about Mrs. Clinton's failings throughout the campaign, using the information
prepared for inclusion in the speech to which I referred on June 7, 2016. response to question I, Part (h)
 I have no recollection of being told during the campaign that Vladimir Putin or the Russian

 I do not remember the date on which it was publicly reported that the DNC had been hacked, but

 of media reporting. I do not recall being provided any information during the campaign about the
 hacking of any of the named entities or individuals before it became the subject of media reporting. response to question U, Part (b)
I recall that in the months leading up to the election there was considerable media reporting about
the possible hacking and release of campaign-related information and there was a lot of talk about
this matter. At the time, I was generally aware of these media reports and may have discussed these
issues with my campaign staff or others, but at this point in time - more than two years later - I
have no recollection of any particular conversation, when it occurred, or who the participants were. response to question II, Part (c)
 I do not recall being aware during the campaign of any communications between the individuals
 named in question II (c) and anyone I understood to be a representative of WikiLeaks or any of
 the other individuals or entities referred to in the question. response to question II, Part (d)
 I made the statement quoted in question II (d) in jest and sarcastically, as was apparent to any
 objective observer. The context of the statement is evident in the full reading or viewing of the
 July 27, 2016 press conference, and I refer you to the publicly available transcript and video of
 that press conference. I do not recall having any discussion about the substance of the statement in
 advance of the press conference. I do not recall being told during the campaign of any efforts by
 Russia to infiltrate or hack the computer systems or email accounts of Hillary Clinton or her
 campaign prior to them becoming the subject of media repo11ingand I have no recollection of any
 particular conversation in that regard. response to question II, Part (e)
 I was in Trump Tower in New York City on October 7, 2016. I have no recollection of being told
 that WikiLeaks possessed or might possess emails related to John Podesta before the release of
 Mr. Podesta's emails was reported by the media. likewise, I have no recollection of being told
 that Roger Stone, anyone acting as an intermediary for Roger Stone, or anyone associated with my
 campaign had communicated with WikiLeaks on October 7, 2016. response to question II, Part (
[^0]: I do not recall being told during the campaign that Roger Stone or anyone associated with my
 campaign had discussions with any of the entities named in the question regarding the content or
 timing of release of hacked emails. response to question ll, Part (g)
 I spoke by telephone with Roger Stone from time to time during the campaign. I have no
 recollection of the specifics of any conversations I had with Mr. Stone between June 1.2016 and
November 8, 2016. I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with him, nor do I recall being aware of
Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign, although I

 for a proposed Trump organization project in Moscow (the "Trump Moscow project"). 1. When were you first informed of discussions about the Trump Moscow project?
 By whom? What were you told about the project?
 ii. Did you sign the letter of intent?
 b. In a statement provided to congress, attached as exhibit C, Michael Cohen stated: "To the
 best of my knowledge, Mr. Trump was never in contact with anyone about this proposal
 other than me on three occasions, including signing a non-binding letter of intent in 2015."
 describe all discussions you had with Mr. Cohen, or anyone else associated with the Trump
 organization, about the Trump Moscow project, including who you spoke with, when, and
 the substance of the discussion(s). c. Did you learn of any communications between Michael Cohen or Felix Sater and any
 Russian government officials, including officials in the office of Dmitry Peskov, regarding
 the Trump Moscow project? If so, identify who provided this info1mation to you, when, and the substance of what you learned. d. Did you have any discussions between June 2015 and June 2016 regarding a potential trip

prospective or actual business interests, investments, or arrangements with Russia or any

Russian interest or Russian individual during the campaign? If yes, describe the business

interests, investments, or arrangements. response to question III, Parts (a) through (g)
sometime in 2015, Michael Cohen suggested to me the possibility of a Trump organization project
in Moscow. As I recall, Mr. Cohen described this as a proposed project of a general type we have
done in the pastina variety of locations. I signed the non-binding Letter of Intent attached to your
questions as exhibit B which required no equity or expenditure on our end and was consistent with
our ongoing efforts to expand into significant markets around the world. I had few conversations with Mr. Cohen on this subject. As I recall, they were brief, and they were
not memorable. I was not enthused about the proposal, and 1 do not recall any discussion of travel
to Russia in connection with it. I do not remember discussing it with anyone else at the Trump
organization, although it is possible. I do not recall being aware at the time of any communications
 between Mr. Cohen or Felix Sater and any Russian government official regarding the Letter of
 Intent. In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that Mr. Cohen sent an email regarding the Letter of Intent to "Mr. Peskov" at a general, public email
 account, which should show there was no meaningful relationship with people in power in Russia. I understand those documents already have been provided to you. I vaguely remember press inquiries and media reporting during the campaign about whether the
 Trump organization had business dealings in Russia. I may have spoken with campaign staff or
 Trump organization employees regarding responses to requests for information, but 1 have no
 current recollection of any particular conversation, with whom L may have spoken, when, or the
 substance of any conversation. As I recall, neither I nor the Trump organization had any projects

 why it was changed, and who was involved?
g. On July 27, 2016, in response to a question about whether you would recognize Crimea as
 Russian territory and lift sanctions on Russia, you said: "We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking." Did you intend to communicate by that statement or at any other time
 during the campaign a willingness to lift sanctions and/or recognize Russia's annexation
 of Crimea if you were elected?
 1. What consideration did you give to lifting sanctions and/or recognizing Russia's
 annexation of Crimea if you were elected? describe who you spoke with about this
 topic, when, the substance of the discussion(s). response to question IV, Parts (a) through (d)
Mr. Manafort was hired primarily because of his delegate work for prior presidential candidates, including Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bob Dole. I knew that Mr. Manafort had done international consulting work and, at sometime before Mr. Manafort left the
campaign, I learned that he was somehow involved with individuals concerning Ukraine, but I do
not remember the specifics of what I knew at the time. l had no knowledge of Mr. Manafort offering briefings on the progress of my campaign to an
individual named Oleg Deripaska, nor do I remember being aware of Mr. Manafort or anyone else
associated with my campaign sending or directing others to send internal Trump campaign
information to anyone I knew to be in Ukraine or Russia at the time or to anyone I understood to
be a Ukrainian or Russian government employee or official. I do not remember Mr. Manafort
communicating to me any particular positions Ukraine or Russia would want the United States to
support. response to question IV, Part (e)
I do not recall being told during the campaign of efforts by Russian officials to meet with me or
with senior members of my campaign. In the process of preparing to respond to these questions, I

the Russian federation, foundation Roscongress, inviting me to participate in the St. Petersburg
international economic Forum to be held in June 2016. The documents show that Ms. Graff
prepared for my signature a brief response declining the invitation. I understand these documents
already have been produced to you. response to question IV, Part (t)

 special counsel'S OFFICE transferred, referred, AND completed CASES
 This appendix identifies matters transferred or referred by the special counsel's Office, as
well as cases prosecuted by the Office that are now completed. A. transfers
 The special counsel's Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination
between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. certain
matters assigned to the Office by the Acting attorney general have not fully concluded as of the
date of this report. After consultation with the Office of the Deputy attorney general, the Office
has transferred responsibility for those matters to other components of the department of justice
and the FBI. Those transfers include:
 1. United States v. Bijan Rafiekian and Kami! Ekim Alptekin
 US. attorney's Office for the eastern district of virginia
 (awaiting trial)
 The Acting attorney general authorized the special counsel to investigate, among other
things, possible criminal conduct by Michael Flynn in acting as an unregistered agent for the
government of Turkey. See August 2, 2017 memorandum from Rod J. Rosenstein to Robert S. Mueller, III. The Acting attorney general later confirmed the special counsel's authority to
investigate Rafiekian and Alptekin because they "may have been jointly involved" with Flynn in
FARA-related crimes. See October 20, 2017 memorandum from associate Depu ty attorney
general Scott schools to Deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein. On December 1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to an information charging him with making
false statements to the FBI about his contacts with the Ru ssian ambassador to the United States. As part of that plea, Flynn agreed to a statement of the offense in which he acknowledged that
the foreign Agents registration Act (FARA) documents he filed on March 7, 2017 "contained
materially false statements and omissions." Flynn's plea occurred before the special counsel had
made a final decision on whether to charge Rafiekian or Alptekin. On March 27, 2018, after
consultation with the Office of the Deputy attorney general, the special counsel's Office referred
the investigation of Rafiekian and Alpt ekin to the national security division (N SD) for any action
it deemed appropriate. The special counsel's Office determined the referral was appropriate
because the investigation of Flynn had been completed, and that investigation had provided the
rationale for the Office's investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin. At NS D's request, the eastern
district of virginia continued the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin. 2. United States v. Michael Flynn
