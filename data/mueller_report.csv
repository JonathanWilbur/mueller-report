9,4,"         This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c), which"
9,5,"states that , ""[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel ' s work, he ... shall provide the Attorney"
9,6,General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions [the Special
9,7,"Counsel] reached."""
9,8,         The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and
9,9,systematic fashion. Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in mid-2016. In
9,10,"June, the Democratic National Committee and its cyber response team publicly announced that"
9,11,Russian hackers had compromised its computer network. Releases of hacked materials-hacks
9,12,that public reporting soon attributed to the Russian government-began                that same month.
9,13,"Additional releases followed in July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in"
9,14,October and November.
9,15,"         In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks's first release of stolen documents, a foreign"
9,16,government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy
9,17,advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign
9,18,government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that
9,19,it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to
9,20,Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July
9,21,"31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign"
9,22,were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities.
9,23,"         That fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government ""directed"
9,24,"recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political"
9,25,"organizations,"" and , "" [t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election"
9,26,"process."" After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia"
9,27,"for having interfered in the election. By early 2017, several congressional committees were"
9,28,examining Russia's interference in the election.
9,29,"         Within the Executive Branch, these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017"
9,30,"appointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. The order appointing the Special Counsel"
9,31,"authorized him to investigate ""the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016"
9,32,"presidential election ,"" including any links or coordination between the Russian government and"
9,33,individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.
9,34,"         As set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel's investigation established that"
9,35,"Russia interfere~ in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a"
9,36,Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J.
9,37,"Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second , a Russian intelligence"
9,38,"service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers"
9,39,working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also
9,40,identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although
9,41,the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump
9,42,"presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit"

10,4,establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
10,5,government in its election interference activities.

10,7,        Below we describe the evidentiary considerations underpinning statements about the
10,8,"results of our investigation and the Special Counsel's charging decisions, and we then provide an"
10,9,overview of the two volumes of our report.
10,10,        The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel's Office found to be
10,11,"supp01ted by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report points out"
10,12,the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other
10,13,"instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with"
10,14,"confidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events"
10,15,occurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there
10,16,was no evidence of those facts.
10,17,        In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted
10,18,"a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of ""collusion."" In so doing,"
10,19,"the Office recognized that the word ""collud[ e]"" was used in communications with the Acting"
10,20,Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has
10,21,frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific
10,22,"offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal"
10,23,"criminal law. For those reasons , the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability"
10,24,"was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the"
10,25,"factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign ""coordinat[ ed]""-a term that appears"
10,26,"in the appointment order-with         Russian election interference activities.       Like collusion,"
10,27,"""coordination"" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood"
10,28,coordination to require an agreement-tacit or express - between the Trump Campaign and the
10,29,Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking
10,30,actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term
10,31,coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the
10,32,Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.

12,4,        RUSSIAN SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN
12,5,        The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference
12,6,operations identified by the investigation - a social media campaign designed to provoke and
12,7,"amplify political and social discord in the United States. The IRA was based in St. Petersburg,"
12,8,"Russia, and received funding from Russian oligarch Y evgeniy Prigozhin and companies he"
12,9,controlled. Pri ozhin is widel re orted to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin
12,10,"        In mid-2014, the IRA sent em lo"
12,11,mission with instructions
12,12,         The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S.
12,13,"political system through what it termed ""information warfare."" The campaign evolved from a"
12,14,"generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S . electoral system, to a"
12,15,targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton.
12,16,The IRA' s operation also included the purchase of political advertisements on social media in the
12,17,"names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United"
12,18,"States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and"
12,19,made contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The
12,20,investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the
12,21,IRA. Section II of this report details the Office's investigation of the Russian social media
12,22,campaign.
12,23,         RUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS
12,24,         At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus ·on supporting candidate Trump in
12,25,"early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions"
12,26,(hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian
12,27,intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian
12,28,Army (GRU) carried out these operations.
12,29,"         In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign"
12,30,"volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU"
12,31,hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
12,32,(DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands
12,33,of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC
12,34,"announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU"
12,35,"began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas ""DCLeaks"" and"
12,36,"""Guccifer 2.0."" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks."

13,3,"        The presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump (""Trump Campaign"" or ""Campaign"")"
13,4,showed interest in WikiLeaks ' s releases of documents and welcomed their otential to damage
13,5,"candidate Clinton . Beginning in June 2016, llfilllillliliilfll~llliillllllilllilli           forecast to"
13,6,senior Campaign officials that WikiLeaks would release information damaging to candidate
13,7,"Clinton. WikiLeaks ' s first release came in July 2016. Around the same time , candidate Trump"
13,8,announced that he hoped Russia would recover emails described as missing from a private server
13,9,used b Clinton when she was Secreta of State he later said that he was s · eakin sarcasticall .
13,10,                                                                           WikiLeaks began releasing
13,11,"Podesta ' s stolen emails on October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released"
13,12,video considered damaging to candidate Trump. Section lII of this Report details the Office's
13,13,"investigation into the Russian hacking operations, as well as other efforts by Trump Campaign"
13,14,supporters to obtain Clinton-related emails.
13,15,         RUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN
13,16,         The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of
13,17,contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government.
13,18,The Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring
13,19,or coordinating with Russia in its election-interference activities. Although the investigation
13,20,established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and
13,21,"worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from"
13,22,"information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that"
13,23,members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its
13,24,election interference activities .
13,25,"         The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the"
13,26,"Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person , invitations for Campaign"
13,27,"officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking"
13,28,improved U.S.-Russian relations. Section IV of this Report details the contacts between Russia
13,29,"and the Trump Campaign during the campaign and transition periods , the most salient of which"
13,30,are summarized below in chronological order.
13,31,         2015. Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump Organization
13,32,real-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow. Candidate Trump signed a Letter
13,33,"oflntent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015, and in January 2016 Trump Organization"
13,34,executive Michael Cohen emailed and spoke about the project with the office of Russian
13,35,government press secretary Dmitry Peskov. The Trump Organization pursued the project through
13,36,"at least June 2016 , including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate Trump."
13,37,         Spring 2016. Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early contact
13,38,"with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and traveled to"
13,39,"Moscow in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip , Mifsud told"
13,40,"Papadopoulos that the Russian government had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands"

14,4,"of emails. One week later, in the first week of May 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a"
14,5,representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from
14,6,the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of
14,7,information damaging to candidate Clinton. Throughout that period of time and for several months
14,8,"thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting"
14,9,between the Campaign and the Russian government. No meeting took place.
14,10,         Summer 2016. Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer of
14,11,"2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President. On"
14,12,"June 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump Campaign officials Donald"
14,13,"Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort to deliver what the email"
14,14,"proposing the meeting had described as ""official documents and information that would"
14,15,"incriminate Hillary."" The materials were offered to Trump Jr. as ""part of Russia and its"
14,16,"government's support for Mr. Trump."" The written communications setting up the meeting"
14,17,showed that the Campaign anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist
14,18,"candidate Trump's electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer ' s presentation did not provide such"
14,19,information.
14,20,"          Days after the June 9 meeting, on June 14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm and the DNC"
14,21,announced that Russian government hackers had infiltrated the DNC and obtained access to
14,22,"opposition research on candidate Trump, among other documents."
14,23,"          In July 2016 , Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal capacity"
14,24,to Moscow and gave the keynote address at the New Economic School. Page had lived and worked
14,25,"in Russia between 2003 and 2007 . After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted"
14,26,"with at least two Russian intelligence officers, one of whom was later charged in 2015 with"
14,27,conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia . Page ' s July 2016 trip to Moscow and his
14,28,advocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention . The Campaign then distanced itself
14,29,"from Page and, by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign."
14,30,          July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from the
14,31,"DNC. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents revealing"
14,32,"information about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there was public reporting that U.S."
14,33,"intelligence agencies had ""high confidence"" that the Russian government was .behind the theft of"
14,34,"emails and documents from the DNC. And within a week of the release, a foreign government"
14,35, informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the
14,36,"Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July 31, 2016 , based on the foreign"
14,37,"government rep01ting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the"
14,38,Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.
14,39,"          Separately, on August 2, 2016 , Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New York"
14,40," City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses to have ties"
14,41,to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for
14,42,"Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel's Office was a ""backdoor"" way for"
14,43, Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men believed the plan would require candidate
14,44,Trump 's assent to succeed (were he to be elected President). They also discussed the status of the

15,5,"Months before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik,"
15,6,and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting.
15,7,"         Fall 2016. On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking in"
15,8,"graphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his candidacy. Less"
15,9,"than an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release: thousands of John Podesta ' s emails that"
15,10,had been stolen by the GRU in late March 2016. The FBI and other U.S. government institutions
15,11,were at the time continuing their investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere
15,12,"in the presidential election. That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and"
15,13,"the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement ""that the Russian"

15,18,"         Post-2016 Election. Immediately after the November 8 election , Russian government"
15,19,officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new
15,20,administration. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts. The
15,21,Russian Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the President-Elect and to
15,22,arrange a call with President Putin. Several Russian businessmen picked up the effort from there.
15,23,"         Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, was among"
15,24,"the Russians who tried to make contact with the incoming administration. In early December , a"
15,25,"business associate steered Dmitriev to Erik Prince, a supporter of the Trump Campaign and an"
15,26,associate of senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Dmitriev and Prince later met face-to-face in
15,27,"January 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed U.S.-Russia relations. During the same period ,"
15,28,another business associate introduced Dmitriev to a friend of Jared Kushner who had not served
15,29,on the Campaign or the Transition Team. Dmitriev and Kushner's friend collaborated on a short
15,30,"written reconciliation plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied had been"
15,31,"cleared through Putin. The friend gave that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration , and"
15,32,Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
15,33,"         On December 29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for having"
15,34,interfered in the election. Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn called Russian
15,35,Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and asked Russia not to escalate the situation in response to the
15,36,"sanctions. The following day, Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in"
15,37,"response to the sanctions at that time. Hours later , President-Elect Trump tweeted, ""Great move"
15,38,"on delay (by V. Putin)."" The next day, on December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him"
15,39,the request had been receiv ed at the highest levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate as a result
15,40,of Flynn's request.

16,4,election through a variety of means to assist Trump's candidacy and harm Clinton ' s. A
16,5,declassified version of the assessment was publicly released that same day.
16,6,"         Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees -the"
16,7,"House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee on"
16,8,"Intelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)-announced              that they would"
16,9,"conduct inquiries, or had already been conducting inquiries, into Russian interference in the"
16,10,election. Then-FBI Director James Corney later confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI's
16,11,"investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the election. On March 20, 2017, in"
16,12,"open-session testimony before HPSCI, Corney stated:"
16,13,"         I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part"
16,14,"         of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts"
16,15,"         to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the"
16,16,         nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and
16,17,         the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the
16,18,"         campaign and Russia ' s efforts ....    As with any counterintelligence investigation,"
16,19,         this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.
16,20,"The investigation continued under then-Director Corney for the next seven weeks until May 9,"
16,21,"2017, when President Trump fired Corney as FBI Director-an action which is analyzed in"
16,22,Volume II of the rep01t.
16,23,"         On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel"
16,24,and authorized him to conduct the investigation that Corney had confirmed in his congressional
16,25,"testimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation , and any other matters within"
16,26,"the scope of 28 C.F .R. § 600.4(a), which generally covers efforts to interfere with or obstruct the"
16,27,investigation.
16,28,         President Trump reacted negatively to the Specia l Counsel's appointment. He told advisors
16,29,"that it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson (Jeff) Sessions"
16,30,"unrecuse from the Russia investigation and to have the Special Counse l removed, and engaged in"
16,31,"efforts to curtail the Specia l Counsel's investigation and prevent the disclosure of evidence to it,"

16,33,are described and ana lyzed in Volume II of the report.

16,37,determined whether the conduct it found amounted to a violation of federal criminal law
16,38,chargeable under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual § 9-27.000 et seq.
16,39,(2018). The standard set forth in the Justice Manual is whether the conduct constitutes a crime ; if
16,40,"so, whether admissib le evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction;"

17,3,and whether prosecution would serve a substantial federal interest that could not be adequately
17,4,served by prosecution elsewhere or through non-criminal alternatives. See Justice Manual § 9-
17,5,27 .220.
17,6,"         Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office's charging decisions,"
17,7,which contain three main components.
17,8,"        First, the Office determined that Russia's two principal interference operations in the 2016"
17,9,U.S. presidential election-the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping operations-
17,10,violated U.S. criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the social media
17,11,campaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by
17,12,undermining through deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign
17,13,"influence in U.S. elections , as well as related counts of identity theft . See United States v. Internet"
17,14,"Research Agency, et al., No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.) . Separately, Russian intelligence officers who"
17,15,carried out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and the personal email accounts of
17,16,"individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to violate , among other federal laws,"
17,17,"the federal computer-intrusion statute, and the have been so char ed. See United States v."
17,18,"Ne ksho, et al., No. 18-cr-215 D.D.C .."
17,19,"         Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to"
17,20,"the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was"
17,21,"not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to"
17,22,charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian
17,23,"principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks ' s releases of hacked"
17,24,"materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence"
17,25,was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with
17,26,representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.
17,27,"         Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Trump"
17,28,"Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated"
17,29,individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian
17,30,election interference. The Office charged some of those lies as violations of the federal false-
17,31,statements statute. Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about
17,32,his interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the transition period. George
17,33,"Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the campaign period , pleaded guilty to lying to"
17,34,"investigators about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the"
17,35,professor who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton .in the form of
17,36,thousands of emails. Former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen leaded uilt to
17,37,makin false statements to Con ress about the Trum Moscow ro ·ect.

18,6,         The Office investigated several other events that have been publicly repot1ed to involve
18,7,"potential Russia-related contacts. For example, the investigation established that interactions"
18,8,between Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump Campaign officials both at the candidate's April
18,9,"2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week of the Republican National"
18,10,"Convention were brief, public, and non-substantive. And the investigation did not establish that"
18,11,one Campaign official's efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing
18,12,assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The
18,13,investigation also did not establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September
18,14,2016 at Sessions's Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential
18,15,campaign.
18,16,"         The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete"
18,17,picture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some individuals invoked
18,18,"their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office ' s"
18,19,"judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other"
18,20,witnesses and information-such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be
18,21,"members of the media-in light of internal Depa11ment of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice"
18,22,"Manual§§ 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was"
18,23,presumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter ( or
18,24,"""taint"") team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes"
18,25,"provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges"
18,26,described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as
18,27,"well-numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United"
18,28,States.
18,29,"         Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct"
18,30,we investigated-including        some associated with the Trump Campaign---deleted relevant
18,31,communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature
18,32,encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records. In
18,33," such cases , the Office was not able to corroborate witness statements through comparison to"
18,34,contemporaneous communications or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared
18,35, inconsistent with other known facts.
18,36,"         Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office"
18,37,"believes to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps,"
18,38,the Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional
18,39, light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.

19,33,"investigatory authority in two subsequent memoranda . A memorandum dated August 2, 2017,"
19,34,"explained that the Appointment Order had been ""worded categorically in order to permit its public"

20,23,"         The Special Counsel structured the investigation in view of his power and authorit y ""to"
20,24,"exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney."" 28 C.F.R:"
20,25,"§ 600 .6. Like a U.S. Attorney 's Office, the Special Counsel's Office considered a range of"
20,26,classified and unclassified information available to the FBI in the course of the Office's Russia
20,27,"investigation , and the Office structured that work around evidence for possible use in prosecutions"
20,28,of federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were identified that warranted prosecution).
20,29,There was substantial evidence immediately available to the Special Counsel at the inception of
20,30,"the investigation in May 2017 because the FBI had, by that time , already investigated Russian"
20,31,election interference for nearly 10 months. The Special Counsel's Office exercised its jud gment
20,32,"regarding what to investigate and did not , for instance, investigate every public report of a contact"
20,33,between the Trump Campaign and Russian -affiliated individuals and entities .
20,34,         The Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination between the Russian
20,35,government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Certain proceedings associated
20,36,with the Office's work remain ongoing. After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney
20,37,"General, the Office has transferred responsibility for those remaining issues to other components"
20,38,of the Department of Justice and FBI. Appendix D lists those transfers.
20,39,         Two district courts confirmed the breadth of the Special Counsel's authority to investigate

21,8,Counsel assembled a team that at its high point included 19 attorneys-five of whom joined the
21,9,Office from private practice and 14 on detail or assigned from other Department of Justice
21,10,components. These attorneys were assisted by a filter team of Department lawyers and FBI
21,11,personnel who screened materials obtained via court process for privileged information before
21,12,turning those materials over to investigators; a support staff of three paralegals on detail from the
21,13,"Department 's Antitrust Division; and an administrative staff of nine responsible for budget,"

21,28,intelligence and counterintelligence information relevant to the FBI's broader national security
21,29,mission. FBI personnel who assisted the Office established procedures to identify and convey
21,30,such information to the FBI. The FBI's Counterintelligence Division met with the Office regularly
21,31,"for that purpose for most of the Office's tenure. For more than the past year, the FBI also"

22,4,"II.  RUSSIAN ""ACTIVE MEASURES"" SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN"
22,5,          The first form of Russian election influence came principally from the Internet Research
22,6,"Agency, LLC (IRA), a Russian organization funded by Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and"
22,7,"companies he controlled, including Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord"
22,8,"Catering (collectively ""Concord""). 2 The IRA conducted social media operations targeted at large"
22,9,U.S. audiences with the goal of sowing discord in the U.S. political system. 3 These operations
22,10,"constituted ""active measures"" (aKTMBHbie          Meporrprumu1),a term that typically refers to operations"
22,11,conducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international affairs. 4
22,12,          The IRA and its employees began operations targeting the United States as early as 2014.
22,13,"Using fictitious U.S. personas, IRA employees operated social media accounts and group pages"
22,14,"designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and accounts, which addressed divisive U.S."
22,15,"political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists. Over time, these"
22,16,social media accounts became a means to reach large U.S. audiences. IRA employees travelled to
22,17,the United States in mid-2014 on an intelligence-gathering mission to obtain information and
22,18,photographs for use in their social media posts.
22,19,          IRA employees posted derogatory information about a number of candidates in the 2016
22,20,"U.S. presidential election. By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting the Trump"
22,21,Campaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton. The IRA made various expenditures to carry
22,22,"out those activities , including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S."
22,23,"persons and entities. Some IRA employees, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their"
22,24,"Russian association, communicated electronically with individuals associated with the Trump"
22,25,"Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities , including the"
22,26,staging of political rallies. 5 The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons
22,27,knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA's interference operation.

46,7,"spearphished the week before. Over the ensuing weeks, the GRU traversed the network,"
46,8,identifying different computers connected to the DCCC network. By stealing network access
46,9,credentials along the way (including those of IT administrators with unrestricted access to the
46,10,"system), the GRU compromised approximately 29 different computers on the DCCC network. 119"
46,11,"         Approximately six days after first hacking into the DCCC network, on April 18, 2016,"
46,12,GRU officers gained access to the DNC network via a virtual private network (VPN) connection 120

46,18,"malware, 123 known as ""X-Agent"" and ""X-Tunnel ""; Mimikatz, a credential-harvesting tool ; and"
46,19,"rar.exe , a tool used in these intrusions to compile and compress materials for exfiltration. X-Agent"
46,20,"was a multi -function hacking tool that allowed Unit 26165 to log keystrokes , take screenshots, and"
46,21,"gather other data about the infected computers (e.g., file directories , operating systems). 124 X-"
46,22,Tunnel was a hacking tool that created an encrypted connection between the victim DCCC/DNC
46,23,computers and GRU-controlled computers outside the DCCC and DNC networks that was capable
46,24,of large -scale data transfers. 125 GRU officers then used X-Tunnel to exfiltrate stolen data from the

49,13,paid for the registration using a pool of bitcoin that it had mined. 138 The dcleaks.com landing page
49,14,"pointed to different tranches of stolen documents , arranged by victim or subject matter. Other"
49,15,dcleaks.com pages contained indexes of the stolen emails that were being released (bearing the

51,5,Guccifer 2.0 persona ultimately released thousands of documents stolen from the DNC and DCCC

56,16,"         As reports attributing the DNC and DCCC hacks to the Russian government emerged ,"
56,17,WikiLeaks and Assange made several public statement s apparentl y designed to obscure the source
56,18, of the materials that WikiLeaks wa s releasing. The file-transfer evidence described abov e and
56,19, other information uncovered during the investigation discredit WikiLeaks's claims about the
56,20, source of material that it posted.
56,21,"         Beginning in the summer of 2016 , Assange and WikiLeaks made a number of statements"
56,22," about Seth Rich , a former DNC staff member who was killed in July 2016. The statements about"
56,23," Rich implied falsely that he had been the source of the stolen DNC emails . On August 9, 2016,"
56,24," the @WikiLeaks Twitt er account posted: ""ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a"
56,25," US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder ofDNC staffer Seth Rich. "" 180"
56,26," Likewise, on August 25, 2016, Assange was asked in an interview, ""Why are you so interested in"
56,27," Seth Rich's killer?"" and responded , ""We 're very interested in anythin g that might be a threat to"

57,11,"         While releasing the stolen emails and documents through DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and"

57,15,"         On July 27 2016 , Unit 26165 targeted email accounts connected to candidate Clinton's"
57,16,"personal office                       . Earlier that day, candidate Trump made public statements that"
57,17,"included the following: ""Russia , if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails"
57,18,"that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press."" 183 The ""30,000"
57,19,"emails"" were apparently a reference to emails described in media accounts as having been stored"
57,20,on a personal server that candidate Clinton had used while serving as Secretary of State.
57,21,"         Within approximately five hours of Trump's statement, GRU officers targeted for the first"
57,22,"time Clinton's personal office. After candidate Trump's remarks , Unit 26165 created and sent"
57,23,malicious links targeting 15 email accounts at the domain                              including an email
57,24,account belonging to Clinton aide                        The investigation did not find evidence of earlier

58,7,"         In addition to targeting individuals involved in the Clinton Campaign, GRU officers also"
58,8,targeted individuals and entities involved in the administration of the elections. Victims included
58,9,"U.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and"
58,10,"county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities. 186 The GRU also"
58,11,targeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related
58,12,"software and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations. 187 The"
58,13,GRU continued to target these victims through the elections in November 2016. While the
58,14,"investigation identified evidence that the GRU targeted these individuals and entities, the Office"
58,15,"did not investigate further. The Office did not, for instance, obtain or examine servers or other"
58,16,"relevant items belonging to these victims. The Office understands that the FBI, the U.S."
58,17,"Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity."
58,18,"         By at least the summer of 2016, GRU officers sought access to state and local computer"
58,19,networks by exploiting known software vulnerabilities on websites of state and local governmental
58,20,"entities. GRU officers, for example, targeted state and local databases of registered voters using a"
58,21,"technique known as ""SQL injection,"" by which malicious code was sent to the state or local"
58,22,website in order to run commands (such as exfiltrating the database contents). 188 In one instance
58,23,"in approximately June 2016, the GRU compromised the computer network of the Illinois State"
58,24,Board of Elections by exploiting a vulnerability in the SBOE's website. The GRU then gained
58,25,"access to a database containing information on millions of registered Illinois voters, 189 and"

59,9,accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U .S. election. 191
59,10,The spearphishing emails contained an attached Word document coded with malicious software
59,11,(commonly referred to as a Trojan) that permitted the GRU to access the infected computer. 192
59,12,The FBI was separately responsible for this investigation. We understand the FBI believes that this

69,3,                  2. Other Potential Campaign Interest in Russian Hacked Materials
69,4,"        Throughout 2016, the Trump Campaign expressed interest in Hillary Clinton's private"
69,5,"email server and whether approximately 30,000 emails from that server had in fact been"
69,6,"permanently destroyed, as reported by the media . Several individuals associated with the"
69,7,Campaign were contacted in 2016 about various efforts to obtain the missing Clinton emails and
69,8,other stolen material in support of the Trump Campaign. Some of these contacts were met with
69,9,"sk~pticism, and nothing came of them; others were pursued to some degree. The investigation did"
69,10,"not find evidence that the Trump Campaign recovered any s~ch Clinton emails, or that these"
69,11,contacts were part of a coordinated effort between Russia and the Trump Campaign.
69,12,                  a. Henry Oknyansky (a/k/a Henry Greenberg)
69,13,"        In the spring of 2016, Trump Campaign advisor Michael Caputo learned through a Florida-"
69,14,"based Russian business partner that another Florida-based Russian, Henry Oknyansky (who also"
69,15,"went by the name Henry Greenberg), claimed to have information pertaining to Hillary Clinton ."
69,16,Caputo notified Roger Stone and brokered communication between Stone and Oknyansky.
69,17,Oknyansky and Stone set up a May 2016 in-person meeting. 260
69,18,"        Oknyansky was accompanied to the meeting by Alexei Rasin, a Ukrainian associate"
69,19,"involved in Florida real estate. At the meeting, Rasin offered to sell Stone derogatory information"
69,20,on Clinton that Rasin claimed to have obtained while working for Clinton. Rasin claimed to
69,21,possess financial statements demonstrating Clinton's involvement in money laundering with
69,22,"Rasin's companies. According to Oknyansky, Stone asked if the amounts in question totaled"
69,23,"millions of dollars but was told it was closer to hundreds of thousands. Stone refused the offer,"
69,24,stating that Trump would not pay for opposition research. 261
69,25,        Oknyansky claimed to the Office that Rasin's motivation was financial. According to
69,26,"Oknyansky, Rasin had tried unsuccessfully to shop the Clinton information around to other"
69,27,"interested parties, and Oknyansky would receive a cut if the information was sold .262 Rasin is"
69,28,noted in public source documents as the director and/or registered agent for a number of Florida
69,29,"companies, none of which appears to be connected to Clinton . The Office found no other evidence"
69,30,that Rasin worked for Clinton or any Clinton-related entities.
69,31,"        In their statements to investigators, Oknyansky and Caputo had contradictory recollections"
69,32,about the meeting. Oknyansky claimed that Caputo accompanied Stone to the meeting and
69,33,"provided an introduction, whereas Caputo did not tell us that he had attended and claimed that he"
69,34,was never told what information Oknyansky offered. Caputo also stated that he was unaware
69,35,Oknyansky sought to be paid for the information until Stone informed him after the fact.263

70,8,                  b. Campaign Efforts to Obtain Deleted Clinton Emails
70,9,"         After candidate Trump stated on July 27, 2016, that he hoped Russia would ""find the"
70,10,"30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump asked individuals affiliated with his Campaign to find the"
70,11,deleted Clinton emails.264 Michael Flynn-who would later serve as National Security Advisor in
70,12,"the Trump Administration - recalled that Trump made this request repeatedly , and Flynn"
70,13,subsequently contacted multiple people in an effort to obtain the emails. 265
70,14,"         Barbara Ledeen and Peter Smith were among the people contacted by Flynn. Ledeen, a"
70,15,"long-time Senate staffer who had previously sought the Clinton emails, provided updates to Flynn"
70,16,"about her efforts throughout the summer of 2016.266 Smith, an investment advisor who was active"
70,17,"in Republican politics, also attempted to locate and obtain the deleted Clinton emails. 267"
70,18,"         Ledeen began her efforts to obtain the Clinton emails before Flynn's request , as early as"
70,19,"December 2015. 268 On December 3, 2015, she emailed Smith a proposal to obtain the emails,"
70,20,"stating, ""Here is the proposal I briefly mentioned to you. The person I described to you would be"
70,21,happy to talk with you either in person or over the phone. The person can get the emails which 1.
70,22,Were classified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies. That would demonstrate what needs to be
70,23,"demonstrated. ""269"
70,24,"         Attached to the email was a 25-page proposal stating that the ""Clinton email server was, in"
70,25,"all likelihood , breached long ago,"" and that the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian intelligence services"
70,26,"could ""re-assemble the server's email content."" 270 The proposal called for a three-phase approach."
70,27,The first two phases consisted of open-source analysis. The third phase consisted of checking with
70,28,"certain intelligence sources ""that have access through liaison work with various foreign services"""
70,29,"to determine if any of those services had gotten to the server. The proposal noted , ""Even if a"
70,30,"single email was recovered and the providence [sic] of that email was a foreign service, it would"
70,31,"be catastrophic to the Clinton campaign[.]"" Smith forwarded the email to two colleagues and"

71,6,"         Just weeks after Trump's July 2016 request to find the Clinton emails , however , Smith"
71,7,"tried to locate and obtain the emails himself. He created a company, raised tens of thousands of"
71,8,"dollars, and recruited security experts and business associates. Smith made claims to others"
71,9,involved in the effort (and those from whom he sought funding) that he was in contact with hackers
71,10,"with ""ties and affiliations to Russia"" who had access to the emails , and that his efforts were"
71,11,coordinated with the Trump Campaign. 273
71,12,"         On August 28, 2016, Smith sent an email from an encrypted account with the subject ""Sec ."
71,13,"Clinton's unsecured private email server"" to an undisclosed list ofrecipients , including Campaign"
71,14,"co-chairman Sam Clovis. The email stated that Smith was ""u]ust finishing two days of sensitive"
71,15,meetings here in DC with involved groups to poke and probe on the above. It is clear that the
71,16,"Clinton 's home -based, unprotected server was hacked with ease by both State-related players , and"
71,17,"private mercenaries. Parties with varying interests , are circling to release ahead of the election. ""274"
71,18,"          On September 2, 2016, Smith directed a business associate to establish KLS Research LLC"
71,19, in furtherance of his search for the deleted Clinton emails. 275 One of the purposes ofKLS Research
71,20,was to manage the funds Smith raised in support of his initiative. 276 KLS Research received over
71,21,"$30,000 during the presidential campaign , although Smith represented that he raised even more"
71,22,money. 277
71,23,"          Smith recruited multiple people for his initiative, including security experts to search for"

72,3,and Kellyanne Conway. 280 The investigation established that Smith communicated with at least
72,4,"Flynn and Clovis about his search for the deleted Clinton emails ,281 but the Office did not identify"
72,5,evidence that any of the listed individuals initiated or directed Smith's efforts.
72,6,"         In September 2016, Smith and Ledeen got back in touch with each other about their"
72,7,"respective efforts. Ledeen wrote to Smith, ""wondering if you had some more detailed reports or"
72,8,memos or other data you could share because we have come a long way in our efforts since we
72,9,last visited ... . We would need as much technical discussion as possible so we could marry it
72,10,"against the new data we have found and then could share it back to you 'your eyes only.' "" 282"
72,11,"         Ledeen claimed to have obtained a trove of emails (from what she described as the ""dark"
72,12,"web"") that purpo1ted to be the deleted Clinton emails. Ledeen wanted to authenticate the emails"
72,13,and solicited contributions to fund that effort . Erik Prince provided funding to hire a tech advisor
72,14,"to ascertain the authenticity of the emails. According to Prince, the tech advisor determined that"
72,15,the emails were not authentic. 283
72,16,         A backup of Smith's computer contained two files that had been downloaded from
72,17,WikiLeaks and that were originally attached to emails received by John Podesta. The files on
72,18,"Smith's computer had creation dates of October 2, 2016, which was prior to the date of their release"
72,19,"by WikiLeaks. Forensic examination, however, established that the creation date did not reflect"
72,20,when the files were downloaded to Smith ' s computer. (It appears the creation date was when
72,21,"WikiLeaks staged the document for release, as discussed in Volume I, Section III.B.3.c , supra. 284)"
72,22,The investigation did not otherwise identify evidence that Smith obtained the files before their
72,23,release by WikiLeaks.
72,24,         Smith continued to send emails to an undisclosed recipient list about Clinton ' s deleted
72,25,"emails until shortly before the election. For example , on October 28, 2016, Smith wrote that there"

74,3,IV. RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT LINKS To AND CONTACTS WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
74,4,"        The Office identified multiple contacts- ""links ,"" in the words of the Appointment Order-"
74,5,between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. The
74,6,Office investigated whether those contacts constituted a third avenue of attempted Russian
74,7,"interference with or influence on the 2016 presidential election. In particular, the investigation"
74,8,examined whether these contacts involved or resulted in coordination or a conspiracy with the
74,9,"Trump Campaign and Russia, including with respect to Russia providing assistance to the"
74,10,Campaign in exchange for any sort of favorable treatment in the future. Based on the available
74,11,"information, the investigation did not establish such coordination ."
74,12,        This Section describes the principal links between the Trump Campaign and individuals
74,13,"with ties to the Russian government , including some contacts with Campaign officials or associates"
74,14,that have been publicly reported to involve Russian contacts. Each subsection begins with an
74,15,"overview of the Russian contact at issue and then describes in detail the relevant facts, which are"
74,16,"generally presented in chronological order, beginning with the early months of the Campaign and"
74,17,"extending through the post-election, transition period."
74,18,"         A. Campaign Period (September 2015 - November 8, 2016)"
74,19,         Russian-government -connected individuals and media entities began showing interest in
74,20,Trump ' s campaign in the months after he announced his candidacy in June 2015. 288 Because
74,21,Trump's status as a public figure at the time was attributable in large part to his prior business and
74,22,"entertainment dealings, this Office investigated whether a busin ess contact with Russia-linked"
74,23,"individuals and entities during the campaign period-the Trump Tower Moscow project , see"
74,24,"Volume l, Section IV.A. I, infra-led to or involved coordination of election assistance."
74,25,"         Outreach from individuals with ties to Russia continued in the spring and summer of 2016,"
74,26,when Trump was moving toward- and eventually becoming -t he Republican nominee for
74,27,"President. As set forth below, the Office also evaluated a series of links during this period:"
74,28,"outreach to two of Trump 's then-recently named foreign policy advisors, including a"
74,29,"representation that Russia had ""dirt"" on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails (Volume I,"
74,30,Sections IV.A.2 & IV.A.3); dealings with a D.C.-based think tank that specializes in Russia and
74,31,"has connections with its government (Volume I, Section IV.A.4); a meeting at Trump Tower"
74,32,"between the Campaign and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on candidate Clinton that was ""part of"
74,33,"Russia and its government's support for [Trump]"" (Volume I, Section IV.A.5); events at the"
74,34,"Republican National Convention (Volume I, Section IV.A.6); post- Convention contacts betwe en"
74,35,"Trump Campaign officials and Russia's ambassador to the United States (Volume I, Section"
74,36,"IV .A.7) ; and contacts through campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had previously worked for"

75,4,         The Trump Organization has pursued and completed projects outside the United States as
75,5,part of its real estate portfolio.       Some projects have involved the acquisition and ownership
75,6," (through subsidiary corporate structures) of property. In other cases , the Trump Organization has"
75,7,"executed licensing deals with real estate developer s and management companies, often local to the"
75,8,country where the project was located. 289
75,9,"         Between at least 2013 and 2016, the Trump Organization explored a similar licensing deal"
75,10," in Russia involving the construction of a Trump-branded property in Moscow. The project,"
75,11," commonly referred to as a ""Trump Tower Moscow"" or ""Trump Moscow"" project , anticipated a"
75,12," combination of commercial , hotel , and residential properties all within the same building."
75,13,"Between 2013 and June 2016, several employees of the Trump Organization, including then-"
75,14,"president of the organization Donald J. Trump, pursued a Moscow deal with several Russian"

80,13,anyone affiliated with the Trump Campaign discussing the political implications of the Trump
80,14,"Moscow project with him. However, Cohen recalled conversations with Trump in which the"

80,19,"approval (whether express or implicit) from the Russian national government , including from the"
80,20,Presidential Administration of Russia. 330 Sater stated that he therefore began to contact the
80,21,Presidential Administration through another Russian business contact. 331 In early negotiations
80,22,"with the Trump Organization , Sater had alluded to the need for government approval and his"
80,23,"attempts to set up meetings with Russian officials . On October 12, 2015 , for example , Sater wrote"
80,24,"to Cohen that ""all we need is Putin on board and we are golden ,"" and that a ""meeting with Putin"
80,25,"and top deputy is tentatively set for the 14th [of October]. "" 332                               this meeting"

81,9,"could offer the Campaign ""political synergy"" and ""synergy on a government level,"" Klokov"
81,10,recommended that Cohen travel to Russia to speak with him and an unidentified intermediary .
81,11,Klokov said that those conversations could facilitate a later meeting in Russia between the

81,15,a near-term trip to Russia to do site surveys and talk over the Trump Moscow project with local

81,17,"intermediary, but was emphatic that all meetings in Russia involving him or candidate Trump--"
81,18,"including a possible meeting between candidate Trump and Putin-would                      need to be ""in"

85,4,"           Into the spring of 2016, Sater and Cohen continued to discuss a trip to Moscow in"
85,5,"  connection with the Trump Moscow project. On April 20, 2016, Sater wrote Cohen, "" [t]he People"
85,6,". wanted to know when you are coming?"" 364 On May 4, 2016, Sater followed up:"

86,5,"On June 13, 2016 , Sater forwarded Cohen an invitation to the Forum signed by the Director of the"
86,6,"Roscongress Foundation, the Russian entity organizing the Forum. 371 Sater also sent Cohen a"
86,7,"Russian visa application and asked him to send two passport photos. 372 According to Cohen, the"
86,8,invitation gave no indication that Peskov had been involved in inviting him. Cohen was concerned
86,9,that Russian officials were not actually involved or were not interested in meeting with him (as
86,10,"Sater had alleged) , and so he decided not to go to the Forum. 373 On June 14, 2016 , Cohen met"
86,11,Sater in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York and informed him that he would not be
86,12,traveling at that time. 374
86,13,                      ii. Candidate Trump's Opportunities to Travel to Russia
86,14,"         The investigation identified evidence that , during the period the Trump Moscow project"
86,15,"was under consideration, the possibility of candidate Trump visiting Russia arose in two contexts."
86,16,"         First, in interviews with the Office, Cohen stated that he discussed the subject of traveling"
86,17,"to Russia with Trump twice: once in late 2015; and again in spring 2016. 375 According to Cohen,"
86,18,"Trump indicated a willingness to travel if it would assist the project significantly. On one occasion,"
86,19,Trump told Cohen to speak with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to coordinate the
86,20,"candidate's schedule. Cohen recalled that he spoke with Lewandowski , who suggested that they"
86,21,"speak again when Cohen had actual dates to evaluate. Cohen indicated , however , that he knew"
86,22,that travel prior to the Republican National Convention would be impossible given the candidate 's
86,23,preexisting commitments to the Campaign. 376
86,24,"         Second, like Cohen, Trump received and turned down an invitation to the St. Petersburg"
86,25,"International Economic Forum. In late December 2015, Mira Duma-a contact oflvanka Trump ' s"
86,26,from the fashion industry-first passed along invitations for Ivanka Trump and candidate Trump
86,27,"from Sergei Prikhodko, a Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. 377 On January 14,"
86,28,"2016, Rhona Graff sent an email to Duma stating that Trump was ""honored to be asked to"

87,5,         It does not appear that Graff prepared that note immediately. According to written answers

87,19,"Forum. 385 Foresman first emailed Graff on March 31, 2016, following a phone introduction"
87,20,brokered through Trump business associate Mark Burnett (who produced the televis ion show The
87,21,"Apprentice). In his email , Foresman referenc ed his long-standing personal and professional"

88,5,"email ( as well as his initial March 2016 email) to Lewandowski. 389 On May 2, 2016 , Graff"
88,6,forwarded Foresman ' s April 30 email-which            suggested an alternative meeting with Donald
88,7,"Trump Jr. or Eric Trump so that Foresman could convey to them information that ""should be"

88,13,the Transition Team as he pursued a possible position in the incoming Administration. 391 When
88,14,"interviewed by the Office , Foresman denied that the specific ""approach "" from ""se nior Kremlin"
88,15,"officials"" noted in his March 31, 2016 email was anything other than Kobyakov's invitation to"
88,16,"Roscongress. According to Foresman, the ""concrete things"" he referenced in the same email were"

88,18,"Russia policy in general, and details of a Ukraine plan supported by a U.S. think tank (EastWest"
88,19,Institute). For esman told the Office that Kobyakov had extended similar invitations through him
88,20,to another Republican presidential candidate and one other politician. Foresman also said that
88,21,Kobyakov had asked Foresman to invite Trump to speak after that other presidential candidate
88,22,"withdrew from the race and the other politician's participation did not work out. 392 Finally ,"
88,23,"Foresman claimed to have no plans to establish a back channel involving Trump, stating the"
88,24,reference to his involvement in the Bush-Putin back channel was meant to burnish his credentials
88,25,to the Campaign. Foresman commented that he had not recogni zed any of the experts announced
88,26,"as Trump's foreign policy team in March 2016, and wanted to secure an in-person meeting with"

112,10," its honorary chairman, Henry Kissinger, at the Time Warner Building in New York. 601 The idea"
112,11, behind the event was to generate interest in CNI's work and recruit new board members for CNI. 602
112,12," Along with Simes, attendees at the event included Jared Kushner , son-in-law of candidate"
112,13, Trump. 603 Kushner told the Office that the event came at a time when the Trump Campaign was
112,14," having trouble securing support from experienced foreign policy professionals and that, as a result ,"
112,15, he decided to seek Simes's assistance during the March 14 event. 604

112,17, Trump had publicly named the team of foreign policy advisors that had been put together on short
112,18," notice. 606 On March 31, 2016, Simes and Kushner had an in-person , one-on-one meeting in"
112,19," Kushner's New York office. 607 During that meeting, Simes told Kushner that the best way to"
112,20, handle foreign-policy issues for the Trump Campaign would be to organize an advisory group of
112,21, experts to meet with candidate Trump and develop a foreign policy approach that was consistent
112,22, with Trump's voice. 608 Simes believed that Kushner was receptive to that suggestion. 609
112,23,          Simes also had contact with other individuals associated with the Trump Campaign
112,24," regarding the Campaign's foreign policy positions. For example, on June 17, 2016, Simes sent"

113,11,Kushner discussed the possibility of CNI hosting a foreign policy speech by candidate Trump.
113,12,"Following those conversations, Simes agreed that he and others associated with CNI would"
113,13,provide behind-the-scenes input on the substance of the foreign-policy speech and that CNI
113,14,"officials would coordinate the logistics of the speech with Sessions and his staff, including"
113,15,"Sessions's chief of staff, Rick Dearborn. 612"
113,16,"         In mid-April 2016, Kushner put Simes in contact with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller"
113,17,and forward ed to Simes an outline of the foreign -policy speech that Miller had prepared .613 Simes
113,18,sent back to the Campaign bullet points with ideas for the speech that he had drafted with CNI
113,19,Executive Director Paul Saunders and board member Richard Burt. 6 14 Simes received subsequent
113,20,"draft outlines from Miller , and he and Saunders spoke to Miller by phone about substantive"
113,21,"changes to the speech. 615 It is not clear , however, whether CNI officials received an actual draft"
113,22,"of the speech for comment; while Saunders recalled having received an actual draft, Simes did not,"
113,23,and the emails that CNI produced to this Office do not contain such a draft. 616
113,24,         After board members expressed concern to Simes that CNl's hosting the speech could be
113,25,"perceived as an endorsement of a particular candidate, CNI decided to have its publication , the"
113,26,"National Interest, serve as the host and to have the event at the National Press Club. 617 Kushner"
113,27,"later requested that the event be moved to the Mayflower Hotel, which was another venue that"

114,3,"         On April 25, 2016, Saunders booked event rooms at the Mayflower to host both the speech"
114,4,and a VIP reception that was to be held beforehand .6 19 Saunders understood that the reception -
114,5,at which invitees would have the chance to meet ·candidate Trump--would be a small event. 620
114,6,Saunders decided who would attend by looking at the list of CNI' s invitees to the speech itself and
114,7,then choosing a subset for the reception. 62 1 CNI's invitees to the reception included Sessions and
114,8,Kislyak. 622 The week before the speech Simes had informed Kislyak that he would be invited to
114,9,"the speech, and that he would have the opportunity to meet Trump. 623"
114,10,"         When the pre -speech reception began on April 27, a receiving line was quickly organized"
114,11,so that attendees could meet Trump. 624 Sessions first stood next to Trump to introduce him to the
114,12,"members of Congress who were in attendance. 625 After those members had been introduced ,"
114,13,"Simes stood next to Trump and introduced him to the CNI invitees in attendance , including"
114,14,"Kislyak. 626 Simes perceived the introduction to be positive and friendly, but thought it clear that"
114,15,Kislyak and Trump had just met for the first time. 627 Kislyak also met Kushner during the pre-
114,16,"speech reception. The two shook hands and chatted for a minute or two, during which Kushner"
114,17,"recalled Kislyak saying , ""we like what your candidate is saying ... it's refreshing. "" 628"
114,18,"         Several public reports state that, in addition to speaking to Kushner at the pre-speech"
114,19,"reception, Kislyak also met or conversed with Sessions at that time. 629 Sessions stated to"
114,20,"investigators, however, that he did not remember any such conversation. 630 Nor did anyone else"
114,21,affiliated with CNI or the National Interest specifically recall a conversation or meeting between
114,22,"Sessions and Kislyak at the pre-speech reception. 631 It appears that , if a conversation occurred at"
114,23,"the pre-speech reception, it was a brief one conducted in public view , similar to the exchange"

115,13,included any additional meetings with Ambassador Kislyak or involved Russian -related matters.
115,14,"With respect to Kislyak contacts , on May 23, 2016, Sessions attended CNI 's Distinguished Service"

116,13,Kushner had periodic contacts with Simes. 648 Those contacts consisted of both in-person meetings
116,14,"and phone conversations , which concerned how to address issues relating to Russia in the"
116,15,Campaign and how to move forward with the advisory group of foreign policy experts that Simes
116,16,"had proposed. 649 Simes recalled that he, not Kushner, initiated all conversations about Russia, and"
116,17,that Kushner never asked him to set up back-channel conversations with Russians. 650 According
116,18,"to Simes, after the Mayflower speech in late April, Simes raised the issue of Russian contacts with"
116,19,"Kushner , advised that it was bad optics for the Campaign to develop hidden Russian contacts, and"
116,20,told Kushner both that the Campaign should not highlight Russia as an issue and should handle
116,21,any contacts with Russians with care. 651 Kushner generally provided a similar account of his

118,9,"Goldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian real-estate developer"

118,11,to provide the Trump Campaign with some official documents and information that would
118,12,"incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia "" as ""part of Russia and its government 's support"
118,13,"for Mr. Trump."" Trump Jr. immediately responded that ""if it ' s what you say I love it,"" and arranged"
118,14,the meeting through a series of emails and telephone calls.
118,15,        Trump Jr. invited campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior advisor Jared Kushner to
118,16,"attend the meeting, and both attended. Members of the Campaign discussed the meeting before it"

118,18,"upcoming meeting to receive adverse information about Clinton , without linking the meeting to"
118,19,"Russia. According to written answers submitted by President Trump, he has no recollection of"
118,20,"learning of the meeting at the time, and the Office found no documentary evidence showing that he"
118,21,was made aware of the meeting--or its Russian connection-before it occurred.

118,24,this period of time. She claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided
118,25,"to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. Trump Jr . requested evidence to support those claims, but"
118,26,Veselnitskaya did not provide such information. She and her associates then turned to a critique of
118,27,"the origins of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 statute that imposed financial and travel sanctions on"
118,28,Russian officials and that resulted in a retaliatory ban on adoptions of Russian children. Trump Jr.
118,29,suggested that the issue could be revisited when and if candidate Trump was elected . After the

124,30,connected to the anticipated June 9 meeting or that the change of topic was attributable to the failure of that

131,11,         Trump Campaign officials met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the week
131,12,of the Republican National Convention . The evidence indicates that those interactions were brief
131,13,"and non-substantive. During platform committee meetings immediately before the Convention,"

131,15,"amendment to the Republican Party platform expressing support for providing ""lethal"" assistance"
131,16,to Ukraine in response to Russian aggression. Gordon requested that platform committee
131,17,"personnel revise the proposed amendment to state that only ""appropriate"" assistance be provided"
131,18,"to Ukraine. The original sponsor of the ""lethal"" assistance amendment stated that Gordon told her"
131,19,(the sponsor) that he was on the phone with candidate Trump in connection with his request to
131,20,"dilute the language.        Gordon denied making that statement to the sponsor, although he"
131,21,acknowledged it was possible he mentioned having previously spoken to the candidate about the
131,22,subject matter. The investigation did not establish that Gordon spoke to or was directed by the
131,23,candidate to make that proposal. Gordon said that he sought the change because he believed the
131,24,proposed language was inconsistent with Trump ' s position on Ukraine.

138,11,"minor ' wink' (or slight push) from [Donald Trump ]."" 840 The email also stated that if Manafort"
138,12,"were designated as the U.S. representative and started the process, Yanukovych would ensure his"
138,13,"reception in Russia ""at the very top level."""
138,14,          Manafort communicated with Kilimnik about peace plans for Ukraine on at least four
138,15,occasions after their first discussion of the topic on August 2: December 2016 (the Kilimnik email
138,16,described above); January 2017; February 2017; and again in the spring of 2018. The Office
138,17,"reviewed numerous Manafort email and text communications, and asked President Trump about"
138,18,the plan in written questions. 841 The investigation did not uncover evidence ofManafort's passing
138,19,along information about Ukrainian peace plans to the candidate or anyone else in the Campaign or
138,20,"the Administration. The Office was not , however, able to gain access to all of Manafort ' s"

138,22,And while Manafort denied that he spoke to members of the Trump Campaign or the new
138,23,"Administration about the peace plan, he lied to the Office and the grand jury about the peace plan"
138,24,"and his meetings with Kilimnik, and his unreliability on this subject was among the reasons that"
138,25,the district judge found that he breached his cooperation agreement. 842
138,26,          The Office could not reliably determine Manafort's ur ose in sharin
138,27,with Kilimnik during the campaign period. Manafort                                                  did not see
138,28,"a downside to sharing campaign information , and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would"

138,37,determined that Manafort had breached his plea agreement and could not be a cooperating witness. The
138,38,judge presiding in Manafort ' s D.C. criminal case found by a preponderance of the evidence that Manafort
138,39," intentionally made multiple false statements to the FBI, the Office, and the grand jury concerning his"
138,40, interactions and communications with Kilimnik (and concerning two other issues). Although the report
138,41,"refers at times to Manafort' s statements , it does so only when those statements are sufficiently corroborated"

139,7,"limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik,"
139,8,the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The
139,9,Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort ' s sharing polling data and
139,10,"Russia's interference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the"
139,11,time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise

139,14,        Manafort' s Russian contacts during the campaign and transition periods stem from his
139,15,consulting work for Deripaska from approximately 2005 to 2009 and his separate political
139,16,"consulting work in Ukraine from 2005 to 2015, including through his company Dl\1P International"
139,17,LLC (DMI). Kilimnik worked for Manafort in Kiev during this entire period and continued to
139,18,"communicate with Manafort through at least June 2018. Kilimnik, who speaks and writes"
139,19,"Ukrain ian and Russian, facilitated many of Manafort's communications with Deripaska and"
139,20,Ukrainian oligarchs.

139,22,"        In approximately 2005, Manafort began working for Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who"
139,23,has a global empire involving aluminum and power companies and who is closely aligned with
139,24,Vladimir Putin. 843 A memorandum describing work that Manafort performed for Deripaska in
139,25,2005 regarding the post-Soviet republics referenced the need to brief the Kremlin and the benefits
139,26,"that the work could confer on ""the Putin Government."" 844 Gates described the work Manafort did"
139,27,"for Deripaska as ""political risk insurance ,"" and explained that Deripaska used Manafort to install"
139,28,friendly political officials in countries where Deripaska had business interests. 845 Manafort's
139,29,company earned tens of millions of dollars from its work for Deripaska and was loaned millions
139,30,of dollars by Deripaska as well. 846

143,3,"         According to Gates, in March 2016, Manafort traveled to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in"
143,4,Florida to meet with Trump. Trump hired him at that time. 877 Manafort agreed to work on the
143,5,"Campaign without pay. Manafort had no meaningful income at this point in time, but resuscitating"
143,6,his domestic political campaign career could be financially beneficial in the future. Gates reported
143,7,"that Manafort intended, if Trump won the Presidency, to remain outside the Administration and"

143,12,"Kolesnikov, 879 the last three being Ukrainian oligarchs who were senior Opposition Bloc"

143,15,emailed the memoranda and a press release announcing Manafort' s appointment to Kilimnik for
143,16,translation and dissemination. 881 Manafort later followed up with Kilimnik to ensure his messages
143,17,"had been delivered, emailing on April 11, 2016 to ask whether Kilimnik had shown ""our friends"""
143,18,"the media coverage of his new role. 882 Kilimnik replied, ""Absolutely. Every article."" Manafort"

143,24,he was owed for previous political consulting work in Ukraine. 884 Gates also explained to the

144,18,"with Manafort for years and was brought into the Campaign by Manafort . Gates stated that , in"

145,11,Deripaska-Pericles issue. 899 Kilimnik replied:
145,12,        I am carefully optimistic on the question of our biggest interest.
145,13,        Our friend [Boyarkin] said there is lately significantly more attention to the campaign in

149,15,"consulting work for the pro-Russian Party of Regions in Ukraine. Despite his resignation,"

149,17,"Manafort told Gates that he still spoke with Kushner, Bannon, and candidate Trump, 935 and some"
149,18,"of those post-resignation contacts are documented in emails. For example, on October 21, 2016,"
149,19,Manafort sent Kushner an email and attached a strategy memorandum proposing that the
149,20,"Campaign make the case against Clinton ""as the failed and corrupt champion of the establishment """
149,21,"and that ""Wikileaks provides the Trump campaign the ability to make the case in a very credible"
149,22,"way - by using the words of Clinton, its campaign officials and DNC members .""936 Later, in a"
149,23,"November 5, 2016 email to Kushner entitled ""Securing the Victory,"" Manafort stated that he was"
149,24,"""really feeling good about our prospects on Tuesday and focusing on preserving the victory,"" and"
149,25,"that he was concerned the Clinton Campaign would respond to a loss by ""mov[ing] immediately"
149,26,"to discredit the [Trump] victory and claim voter fraud and cyber-fraud, including the claim that"
149,27,"the Russians have hacked into the voting machines and tampered with the results.""937"
149,28,"         Trump was elected President on November 8, 2016. Manafort told the Office that, in the"

152,18,"          Trump was elected President on November 8, 2016. Beginning immediately after the"
152,19," election , individuals connected to the Russian government started contacting officials on the"
152,20, Trump Campaign and Transition Team through multiple channels-sometimes                   through Russian
152,21, Ambassador Kislyak and at other times through individuals who sought reliable contacts through
152,22, U.S. persons not formally tied to the Campaign or Transition Team. The most senior levels of the
152,23, Russian government encouraged these efforts. The investigation did not establish that these efforts
152,24, reflected or constituted coordination between the Trump Campaign and Russia in its election-
152,25, interference activities.

172,17,"government and the incoming Administration. 1179 Based on what Simes had read in the media, he"
172,18,stated that he already had concerns that Trump's business connections could be exploited by

172,20,in facilitating any connection. 1180

172,24,         in Luxembourg concerning Project A. There is an interest and an understanding for the

175,8,the 2016 election. 1207 Despite Kushner ' s conclusion that Kislyak did not wield influence inside
175,9,"the Russian government, the Transition Team turn ed to Flynn's relationship with Kislyak on"
175,10,"both issues. As to the sanctions, Flynn spoke by phone to K.T. McFarland , his incoming deputy ,"
175,11,to prepare for his call to Kislyak; McFarland was with the President-Elect and other senior
175,12,members of the Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago at the time. Although transition officials at Mar-
175,13,"a-Lago had some concern about possible Russian reactions to the sanctions, the investigation did"
175,14,not identify evidence that the President-Elect asked Flynn to make any request to Kislyak. Flynn

182,3,V. PROSECUTION AND DECLINATION DECISIONS
182,4,"        The Appointment Order authorized the Special Counsel's Office ""to prosecute federal"
182,5,"crimes arising from [its] investigation"" of the matters assigned to it. In deciding whether to"
182,6,"exercise this prosecutorial authority , the Office has been guided by the Principles of Federal"
182,7,"Prosecution set forth in the Justice (formerly U.S. Attorney's) Manual. In particular, the Office"
182,8,has evaluated whether the conduct of the individuals considered for prosecution constituted a
182,9,federal offense and whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain
182,10,a conviction for such an offense. Justice Manual § 9-27.220 (2018). Where the answer to those
182,11,"questions was yes, the Office further considered whether the prosecution would serve a substantial"
182,12,"federal interest, the individuals were subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction , and"
182,13,there existed an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution. Id.
182,14,"        As explained below, those considerations led the Office to seek charges against two sets of"
182,15,Russian nationals for their roles in er etratin the active-measures social media cam ai n and
182,16,similarly determined that the contacts between Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals
182,17,"either did not involve the commission of a federal crime or, in the case of campaign-finance"
182,18,"offenses, that our evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a criminal conviction. At the"
182,19,"same time, the Office concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution supported charging"
182,20,certain individuals connected to the Campaign with making false statements or otherwise
182,21,obstructing this investigation or parallel congressional investigations .
182,22,"        A. Russian ""Active Measures"" Social Media Campaign"
182,23,"         On February 16, 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an"
182,24,indictment charging 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities-including the Internet
182,25,Research Agency (IRA) and Concord Management and Consulting LLC (Concord)- with
182,26,violating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes. 1276
182,27,The indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count

182,29,five defendants with aggravated identity theft (Counts Three through Eight). Internet Research

183,3,         Although members of the IRA had contact with individuals affiliated with the Trump
183,4,"Campaign, the indictment does not charge any Trump Campaign official or any other U.S. person"
183,5,with participating in the conspiracy. That is because the investigation did not identify evidence
183,6,that any U.S. person who coordinated or communicated with the IRA knew that he or she was
183,7,speaking with Russian nationals engaged in the criminal conspiracy. The Office therefore
183,8,determined that such persons did not have the knowledge or criminal purpose required to charge
183,9,them in the conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One) or in the separate count alleging
183,10,a wire- and bank-fraud conspiracy involving the IRA and two individual Rus sian nationals (Count
183,11,Two).

184,17," Stolen Property Act (NSPA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314 and 2315. The statutes comprising the NSPA cover"

188,3,         C. Russian Government Outreach and Contacts
188,4,"         As explained in Section IV above, the Office's investigation uncovered evidence of"
188,5,"numerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or"
188,6,claiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts under several
188,7,"sets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate"
188,8,"in the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges"
188,9,under these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section IV above-with the
188,10,exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on
188,11,behalf of Ukraine.
188,12,         One of the interactions between the Trump Campaign and Russian -affiliated individuals-
188,13,"the June 9, 2016 meeting between high-ranking campaign officials and Russians promising"
188,14,derogatory information on Hillary Clinton-implicates         an additional body of law: campaign -
188,15,finance statutes. Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources
188,16,"raise difficult statutory and constitutional questions. As ex lained below, the Office evaluated"
188,17,those questions in connection with the June 9 meeting
188,18,"The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal questions were resolved favorably"
188,19,"to the government , a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or"
188,20,individuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law.
188,21,"         Finally, although the evidence of contacts between Campaign officials and Russia -"
188,22,"affiliated individuals may not have been sufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges , several"
188,23,U.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other
188,24,steps to obstruct the Office's investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore
188,25,charged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice.
188,26,                 1. Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion
188,27,"         As an initial matter , this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the"
188,28,"collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of ""collusion,"" but through the lens"
188,29,"of conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word ""collud[ e]"" appears in the"
188,30,"Acting Attorney General's August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has frequently been invoked in public"
188,31,"reporting; and it is sometimes referenced in antitrust law, see, e.g., Brooke Group v. Brown &"
188,32,"Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusion is not a specific offense or"
188,33,theory of liability found in the U .S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the
188,34,"contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as"
188,35,"that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute , 18 U .S.C. § 371. See Black 's Law"
188,36,"Dictionary 321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is ""[a]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain"
188,37,"something forbidden by law""); 1 Alexander Burrill , A Law Dictionary and Glossary 311 (1871)"
188,38,"(""An agreement between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ"
188,39,"such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.""); 1 Bouvier 's Law Dictionary 352"
188,40,                                                   180

189,3,"(1897) (""An agreement between two or more persons to defraud a person of his rights by the forms"
189,4,"of law, or to obtain an object forbidden by law."")."
189,5,"         For that reason, this Office ' s focus in resolving the question of joint criminal liability was"
189,6,"on conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term ""collusion."" The Office"
189,7,considered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials and Russia-linked
189,8,individuals could trigger liability for the crime of conspiracy-either under statutes that have their
189,9,"own conspiracy language (e.g. , 18 U .S.C. §§ 1349, 195l(a)) , or under the general conspiracy"
189,10,statute (18 U.S .C. § 371). The investigation did not establish that the contacts described in Volume
189,11,"I, Section IV, supra , amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal"
189,12,"criminal law- including foreign-fnfluence and campaign-finance laws , both of which are"
189,13,discussed further below. The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with the
189,14,"Trump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts, either"
189,15,under a specific statute or under Section 371 's offenses clause.
189,16,         The Office also did not charge any campaign official or associate with a conspiracy under
189,17,Section 371 's defraud clause. That clause criminalizes participating in an agreement to obstruct a
189,18,lawful function of the U.S. government or its agencies through deceitful or dishon est means. See
189,19,"Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 861 (1966); Hammerschmidt v. United States, 265 U.S ."
189,20," 182, 188 (1924); see also United States v. Concord Mgmt. & Consulting LLC, 34 7 F. Supp. 3d 38,"
189,21,46 (D.D .C.2018). The investigation did not establish any agreement among Campaign officials-
189,22,or between such officials and Russia-linked individuals-to interfere with or obstruct a lawful
189,23,"function of a government agency during the campaign or transition period. And , as discussed in"
189,24,"Volume I, Section V.A , supra , the investigation did not identify evidence that any Campaign"
189,25,official or associate knowingly and intentionally participated in the conspiracy to defraud that the
189,26,"Office charged , namely, the active-measures conspiracy described in Volume I, Section II, supra ."
189,27,"Accordingly, the Office did not charge any Campaign associate or other U.S. person with"
189,28,conspiracy to defraud the United States based on the Russia-relat ed contact s described in Section
189,29,IV above.
189,30,                  2. Potential Coordination: Foreign Agent Statutes (FARA and 18 U.S .C. § 951)
189,31,         The Office next assessed the potential liability of Campaign-affiliated individuals under
189,32,"federal statutes regulating actions on behalf of, or work done for, a foreign government."
189,33,                  a. Governing Law
189,34,"         Under 18 U.S.C . § 951, it is generally illegal to act in the United States as an agent of a"
189,35,foreign government without providing notice to the Attorney General. Although the defendant
189,36," must act on behalf of a foreign government (as oppos ed to other kinds of foreign entities) , the acts"
189,37,"need not involve espionage ; rather, acts of any typ e suffice for liability. See United States v."
189,38,"Duran, 596 F.3d 1283, 1293-94 (11th Cir. 2010); United States v. Latchin, 554 F.3d 709 , 715 (7th"
189,39," Cir. 2009) ; United States v. Dumeisi, 424 F.3d 566 , 581 (7th Cir. 2005) . An ""agent of a foreign"

190,3,         The crime defined by Section 951 is complete upon knowingly acting in the United States
190,4,as an unregistered foreign-government agent. 18 U.S.C. § 95l(a). The statute does not require
190,5,"willfulness, and knowledge of the notification requirement is not an element of the offense. United"
190,6,"States v. Campa, 529 F.3d 980, 998-99 (11th Cir. 2008); Duran, 596 F.3d at 1291-94 ; Dumeisi ,"
190,7,424 F.3d at 581.
190,8,         The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) generally makes it illegal to act as an agent
190,9,of a foreign principal by engaging in certain (largely political) activities in the United States
190,10,without registering with the Attorney General. 22 U.S.C. §§ 611-621. The triggering agency
190,11,"relationship must be with a foreign principal or ""a person any of whose activities are directly or"
190,12,"indirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in major part by a"
190,13,"foreign principal. "" 22 U.S.C. § 61 l(c)(l). That includes a foreign government or political party"
190,14,and various foreign individuals and entities. 22 U.S.C. § 611(6). A covered relationship exists if
190,15,"a person ""acts as an agent , representative , employee, or servant"" or ""in any other capacity at the"
190,16,"order, request, or under the [foreign principal's] direction or control. "" 22 U.S.C. § 61 l(c)(l) . It"
190,17,"is sufficient if the person ""agrees, consents, assumes or purports to act as, or who is or holds"
190,18,"himself out to be , whether or not pursuant to contractual relationship , an agent of a foreign"
190,19,"principal."" 22 U.S.C. § 61 l(c)(2)."
190,20,"         The triggering activity is that the agent ""directly or through any other person "" in the United"
190,21,"States (1) engages in ""political activities for or in the interests of [the] foreign principal ,"" which"
190,22,"include s attempts to influence federal officials or the public; (2) acts as ""public relations counsel,"
190,23,"publicity agent, information-service employee or political consultant for or in the interests of such"
190,24,"foreign principal ""; (3) "" solicits, collects, disburses , or dispenses contributions , loans, money , or"
190,25,"other things of value for or in the interest of such foreign principal"" ; or (4) ""re presents the interests"
190,26,"of such foreign principal"" before any federal agency or official. 22 U .S.C. § 611 (c)(1 )."
190,27,"         It is a crime to engage in a "" [w ]illful violation of any provision of the Act or any regulation"
190,28,"thereunder. "" 22 U.S .C. § 618(a)(l). It is also a crime willfully to make false statements or"
190,29,omissions of material facts in FARA registration statements or supplements.                         22 U.S.C.
190,30,"§ 618(a)(2). Most violations have a maximum penalty of five years of imprisonment and a $10,000"

190,32,                   b. Application
190,33,         The investigation uncovered extensive evidence that Paul Manafort's and Richard Oates's
190,34,pre -campaign work for the government of Ukraine violated FARA. Manafort and Gates were
190,35,charg ed for that conduct and admitted to it when they pleaded guilty to superseding criminal

191,4,in that case.
191,5,"         In addition, the investigation produced evidence of FARA violations involving Michael"
191,6,"Flynn. Those potential violations, however, concerned a country other than Russia (i.e., Turkey)"
191,7,and were resolved when Flynn admitted to the underlying facts in the Statement of Offense that
191,8,"accompanied his guilty plea to a false-statements charge . Statement of Offense, United States v."

191,11,"         The investigation did not, however, yield evidence sufficient to sustain any charge that any"
191,12,individual affiliated with the Trump Campaign acted as an agent of a foreign principal within the
191,13,"meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government"
191,14,"of Russia, or any official thereof. In particular, the Office did not find evidence likely to prove"
191,15,"beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos ,"
191,16,"and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian overnrnent-or at its direction control, or"
191,17,re uest-durin       the relevant time eriod. 1282
191,18,"As a result, the Office did not charge                 any other Trump Campaign official with violating"
191,19,"FARA or Section 951, or attempting or conspiring to do so, based on contacts with the Russian"
191,20,government or a Russian principal.
191,21,"         Finally , the Office investigated whether one of the above campaign advisors-George"
191,22,"Papadopoulos-acted as an agent of, or at the direction and control of, the government of Israel."
191,23,While the investigation revealed significant ties between Papadopoulos and Israel (and search
191,24,"warrants were obtained in part on that basis), the Office ultimately determined that the evidence"
191,25,was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction under FARA or Section 951.
191,26,                  3. Campaign Finance
191,27,         Several areas of the Office's investigation involved efforts or offers by foreign nationals to
191,28,provide negative information about candidate Clinton to the Trump Campaign or to distribute that
191,29,"information to the public, to the anticipated benefit of the Campaign. As explained below , the"
191,30,"Office considered whether two of those efforts in particular - the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump"
191,31,          1282
191,32,"               On four occasions, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) issued warrants based"
191,33,"on a finding of probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a foreign power. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(b ),"
191,34, 1805(a)(2)(A). The FISC 's probable-cause finding was based on a different (and lower) standard than the
191,35,"one governing the Office's decision whether to bring charges against Page, which is whether admissible"
191,36,evidence would likely be sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Page acted as an agent of the
191,37,"Russian Federation during the period at issue. Cf United States v. Cardoza, 713 F.3d 656, 660 (D.C. Cir."
191,38,"2013) ( explaining that probable cause requires only ""a fair probability ,"" and not ""certainty, or proof beyond"
191,39,"a reasonable doubt, or proof by a preponderance of the evidence"")."

193,12,misdemeanor. 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(l)(A)(ii).
193,13,                         b. Application to June 9 Trump Tower Meeting
193,14,         The Office considered whether to charge Trump Campaign officials with crimes in
193,15,"connection with the June 9 meeting described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra. The Office"
193,16,"concluded that, in light of the government's substantial burden of proof on issues of intent"
193,17,"(""knowing"" and ""willful"") , and the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered information,"
193,18,"criminal charges would not meet the Justice Manual standard that ""the admissible evidence will"
193,19,"probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction. "" Justice Manual§ 9-27.220."
193,20,"         In brief, the key facts are that, on June 3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald Trump"
193,21,"Jr., to pass along from Emin and Aras Agalarov an ""offer"" from Russia's ""Crown prosecutor"" to"
193,22,"""the Trump campaign"" of ""official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and"
193,23,"her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr. ' s] father."" The email described"
193,24,"this as ""very high level and sensitive information"" that is ""part of Russia and its government's"
193,25,"support to Mr. Trump-helped along by Aras and Emin."" Trump Jr. responded: ""if it's what you"
193,26,"say I love it especially later in the summer."" Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov had follow-up"
193,27,"conversations and, within days, scheduled a meeting with Russian representatives that was"
193,28,"attended by Trump Jr ., Manafort , and Kushner. The communications setting up the meeting and"
193,29,the attendance by high-level Campaign representatives support an inference that the Campaign
193,30,anticipated receiving derogatory documents and information from official Russian sources that
193,31,could assist candidate Trump's electoral prospects.
193,32,         This series of events could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and
193,33,"donations by foreign nationals , 52 U .S.C. § 3012 l(a)(l )(A). Specifically, Goldstone passed along"
193,34,"an offer purportedly from a Russian government official to provide ""official documents and"
193,35,"information"" to the Trump Campaign for the purposes of influenc ing the presidential election."
193,36,Trump Jr. appears to have accepted that offer and to have arranged a meeting to receive those
193,37,materials. Documentary evidence in the form of email chains supports the inference that Kushner
193,38,and Mana fort were aware of that purpose and attended the June 9 meeting anticipating the receipt
193,39,of helpful information to the Campaign from Russian sources.
193,40,         The Office considered whether this evidence would establish a conspiracy to violate the
193,41,"foreign contributions ban, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 ; the solicitation of an illegal foreign -"
193,42,"source contribution; or the acceptance or receipt of ""an express or implied promise to make a"

194,4,"reasonable arguments that the offered information would constitute a ""thing of value"" within the"
194,5,"meaning of these provisions, but the Office determined that the government would not be likely to"
194,6,"obtain and sustain a conviction for two other reasons: first, the Office did not obtain admissible"
194,7,evidence likely to meet the government's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these
194,8,"individuals acted ""willfully,"" i.e., with general knowledge of the illegality of their conduct; and,"
194,9,"second, the government would likely encounter difficulty in proving beyond a reasonable doubt"
194,10,"that the value of the promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation, see 52"
194,11,U.S.C. § 30109(d)(l)(A)(i).
194,12,                     i. Thing-of Value Element
194,13,"         A threshold legal question is whether providing to a campaign ""documents and"
194,14,"information"" of the type involved here would constitute a prohibited campaign contribution. The"
194,15,"foreign contribution ban is not limited to contributions of money. It expressly prohibits ""a"
194,16,"contribution or donation of money or other thing of value."" 52 U.S.C. § 3012l(a)(l)(A), (a)(2)"
194,17,"(emphasis added). And the term ""contribution"" is defined throughout the campaign-finance laws"
194,18,"to ""include[]"" ""any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value."""
194,19,52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i) (emphasis added).
194,20,"          The phrases ""thing of value"" and ""anything of value "" are broad and inclusive enough to"
194,21,"encompass at least some forms of valuable information. Throughout the United States Code, these"
194,22,"phrases serve as ""term[ s] of art"" that are construed ""broad[ly]."" United States v. Nilsen , 967 F .2d"

194,25,"property). For example, the term ""thing of value"" encompasses law enforcement reports that"
194,26,"would reveal the identity of informants, United States v. Girard, 601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1979);"
194,27,"classified materials, United States v. Fowler, 932 F.2d 306 , 310 (4th Cir . 1991); confidential"

194,29,"secret grand jury information, United States v. Jeter, 775 F.2d 670, 680 (6th Cir . 1985); and"
194,30,"information about a witness's whereabouts, United States v. Sheker , 618 F.2d 607 , 609 (9th Cir."
194,31," 1980) (per curiam). And in the public corruption context , "" ' thing of value' is defined broadly to"
194,32,"include the value which the defendant subjectively attaches to the items received."" United States"

194,34,          Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations recognize the value to a campaign of at
194,35," least some forms of information, stating that the term ""anything of value "" includes ""the provision"

195,5,         These authorities would support the view that candidate-related opposition research given
195,6,to a campaign for the purpose of influencing an election could constitute a contribution to which
195,7,"the foreign-source ban could apply. A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision offunds,"
195,8,but also by the provision of derogatory information about an opponent. Political campaigns
195,9,frequently conduct and pay for opposition research. A foreign entity that engaged in such research
195,10,"and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and"
195,11,"a greater tendency to ingratiate the donor to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things"
195,12,"of value. At the same time , no judicial decision has treated the voluntary provision of"
195,13,uncompensated opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount
195,14,to a contribution under campaign -finance law. Such an interpretation could have implications
195,15,"beyond the foreign-source ban , see 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a) (imposing monetary limits on campaign"
195,16,"contributions), and raise First Amendment questions. Those questions could be especially difficult"
195,17,where the information consisted simply of the recounting of historically accurate facts. It is
195,18,uncertain how courts would resolve those issues.
195,19,                     ii. Willfulness
195,20,"          Even assuming that the promised ""documents and information that would incriminate"
195,21,"Hillary"" constitute a ""thing of value"" under campaign-finance law, the government would"
195,22,"encounter other challenges in seeking to obtain and sustain a conviction. Most significantly, the"
195,23,government has not obtained admissible evidence that is likely to establish the scienter requirement
195,24,"beyond a reasonable doubt. To prove that a defendant acted ""knowingly and willfully, "" the"
195,25,government would have to show that the defendant had general knowledge that his conduct was
195,26,"unlawful. U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses 123 (8th ed. Dec."
195,27,"2017) (""Election Offenses""); see Bluman , 800 F. Supp. 2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation"
195,28,"requires ""proof of the defendant's knowledge of the law""); Danielczyk, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 577"
195,29,"(""knowledge of general unlawfulness ""). ""This standard creates an elevated scienter element"
195,30,"requiring , at the very least, that application of the law to the facts in question be fairly clear. When"
195,31,"there is substantial doubt concerning whether the law applies to the facts of a particular matter, the"
195,32,"offender is more likely to have an intent defense."" Election Offenses 123.               ·"
195,33,"          On the facts here, the government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable"
195,34, doubt that the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful.
195,35,The investigation has not developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar
195,36, with the foreign-contribution ban or the application of federal law to the relevant factual context.
195,37, The government does not have strong evidence of surreptitious behavior or effo11sat concealment
195,38, at the time of the June 9 meeting. While the government has evidence of later efforts to prevent
195,39, disclosure of the nature of the June 9 meeting that could circumstantially provide support for a
195,40," showing of scienter, see Volume II, Section II.G, infra, that concealment occurred more than a"
195,41," year later, involved individuals who did not attend the June 9 meeting , and may reflect an intention"
195,42," to avoid political consequences rather than any prior knowledge of illegality. Additionally, in light"
195,43," of the unresolv ed legal questions about whether giving ""documents and information"" of the sort"
195,44," offered here constitutes a campaign contribution, Trump Jr. could mount a factual defense that he"
195,45,                                                     187

196,3,did not believe his response to the offer and the June 9 meeting itself violated the law. Given his
196,4,"less direct involvement in arranging the June 9 meeting, Kushner could likely mount a similar"
196,5,"defense. And, while Manafort is experienced with political campaigns, the Office has not"
196,6,developed evidence showing that he had relevant knowledge of these legal issues.
196,7,                     iii. Difficulties in Valuing Promised Information
196,8,         The Office would also encounter difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the
196,9,"value of the promised documents and information exceeds the $2,000 threshold for a criminal"
196,10,"violation, as well as the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment. See 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(l)."
196,11,The type of evidence commonly used to establish the value of non-monetary contributions-such
196,12,as pricing the contribution on a commercial market or determining the upstream acquisition cost
196,13,or the cost of distribution-would         likely be unavailable or ineffective in this factual setting.
196,14,"Although damaging opposition research is surely valuable to a campaign , it appears that the"
196,15,information ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable. And while value in a conspiracy
196,16,"may well be measured by what the participants expected to receive at the time of the agreement,"
196,17,"see, e.g., United States v. Tombrello, 666 F.2d 485 , 489 (11th Cir. 1982), Goldstone's description"
196,18,"of the offered material here was quite general. His suggestion of the information's value-i.e.,"
196,19,"that it would ""incriminate Hillary "" and ""would be very useful to [Trump Jr.'s] father ""-was non-"
196,20,"specific and may have been understood as being of uncertain worth or reliability, given"
196,21,Goldstone's lack of direct access to the original source. The uncertainty over what would be
196,22,"delivered could be reflected in Trump Jr. ' s response (""if it's what you say I love it"") (emphasis"
196,23,added).
196,24,"         Accordingly , taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in a"
196,25,"campaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required valuation, the Office"
196,26,decided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against Trump Jr. or other campaign
196,27,officials for the events culminating in the June 9 meeting .

199,5,         The Office determined that certain individuals associated with the Campaign lied to
199,6,investigators about Campaign contacts with Russia and have taken other actions to interfere with
199,7,"the investigation. As explained below, the Office therefore charged some U.S. persons connected"
199,8,to the Campaign with false statements and obstruction offenses.
199,9,                 a. Overview Of Governing Law
199,10,         False Statements. The principal federal statute criminalizing false statements to
199,11,"government investigators is 18 U.S.C. § 1001. As relevant here , under Section 1001(a)(2), it is a"
199,12,"crime to knowingly and willfully ""make[] any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement"
199,13,"or representation"" ""in any matter within the jurisdiction of th e executive ... branch of the"
199,14,"Government."" An FBI investigation is a matter within the Executive Branch's jurisdiction. United"
199,15,"States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475, 479 (1984). The statute also applies to a subset of legislative"
199,16,"branch actions-viz., administrative matters and ""investiga tion[s] or review[ s ]"" conducted by a"
199,17,congressional committee or subcommittee. 18 U.S.C. § 1001(c)(l) and (2); see United States v.

199,19,"          Whether the statement was made to law enforcement or congressional investigators , the"
199,20,government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the same basic non -jurisdictional elements :
199,21,"the stat ement was false, fictitious, or fraudulent ; the defendant knew both that it was false and that"
199,22,"it was unlawful to make a false statement; and the false stateme nt was material. See, e.g., United"
199,23,"States v. Smith , 831 F.3d 1207, 1222 n.27 (9th Cir. 2017) (listing elements); see also Ninth Circu it"

199,27,government must prove that the statement was actually false; a statement that is misleading but

201,35,cybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have misunderstood their

201,41,"in the language of that email chain (""Baby, thank you!""), Mifsud may have been involved in a"

202,14,ambassador.
202,15,"         First , Flynn made two false statements about his conversations with Russian Ambassador"

202,17,for interfering with the 2016 presidential election and Russia was considering its response. See

202,19,escalating the situation in response to the United States's imposition of sanctions. That statement

202,21,the call immediately after speaking to a senior Transition Team official (K.T. McFarland) about
202,22,what to communicate to Kislyak. Flynn then spoke with McFarland again after the Kislyak call to

202,24,remember a follow-up conversation in which Kislyak stated that Russia had chosen to moderate
202,25,"its response to the U.S. sanctions as a result of Flynn's request. On December 31, 2016, Flynn in"

203,4,of Russia and other countries regardin g a resolution submitted by Egypt to the United Nations
203,5,"Security Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically, Flynn stated that he only asked the"

203,7,of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. That statement was false. On
203,8,"December 22, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak , informed him of the incoming Trump Administration's"
203,9,"opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn"
203,10,also falsely stated that Kislyak never described Russia's response to his December 22 request

203,12,Russia would not vote against the resolution if it came to a vote. See Flynn Statement of Offense

203,14,         Flynn made these false statements to the FBI at a time when he was serving as National

203,33,"         In 2017, Cohen was called to testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on"
203,34,"Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), both of which were"
203,35,investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links between
203,36,"Russia and the presidential campaigns. In late August 2017, in advance of his testimony , Cohen"

204,7,         Each of the foregoing representations in Cohen's two-page statement was false and
204,8,misleading. Consideration of the project had extended through approximately June 2016 and
204,9,included more than three progress reports from Cohen to Trump. Cohen had discussed with Felix
204,10,"Sater his own travel to Russia as part of the project , and he had inquired about the possibility of"
204,11,Trump traveling there- both with the candidate himself and with senior campaign official Corey
204,12,Lewandowski. Cohen did recall that he had received a response to the email that he sent to Russian
204,13,"government spokesman Dmitry Peskov-in particular, that he received an email reply and had a"
204,14,follow-up phone conversation with an English-speaking assistant to Peskov in mid-January 2016.
204,15,"Cohen Information ,i 7. Cohen knew the statements in the letter to be false at the time, and"
204,16,admitted that he made them in an effort (1) to minimize the links between the project and Trump

204,18,"before the first vote in the Republican Party primary process , in the hopes of limiting the ongoing"
204,19,Russia investigations. Id.
204,20,         Given the nature of the false statements and the fact that he repeated them during his initial
204,21,"interview with the Office, we charged Cohen with violating Section 1001. On November 29, 2018 ,"
204,22,Cohen pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to a single-count information charging him
204,23,"with making false statements in a matter within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch , in"
204,24,violation of 18 U.S.C. § 100l(a)(2) and (c). Cohen Information. The case was transferred to the
204,25,district judge presiding over the separate prosecution of Cohen pursued by the Southern District
204,26,"of New York (after a referral from our Office). On December 7, 2018 , this Office submitted a"
204,27,letter to that judge recommending that Cohen's cooperation with our investigation be taken into
204,28,account in sentencing Cohen on both the false-statements charge and the offenses in the Southern
204,29,"District prosecution. On December 12, 2018, the judge sentenced Cohen to two months of"
204,30,"imprisonment on the false-statements count, to run concurrently with a 36-month sentence"
204,31,imposed on the other counts.

205,4,"        As set forth in Volume I, Section IV.A.6, supra, the investigation established that, while a"
205,5,"U.S. Senator and a Trump Campaign advisor , former Attorney General Jeff Sessions interacted"
205,6,with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the week of the Republican National Convention in July

206,3,"foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. , in April 2016, and that it is"
206,4,possible that they met briefly at that reception .
206,5,"        The Office considered whether , in light of these interactions, Sessions committed perjury"
206,6,"before, or made false statements to, Congress in connection with his confirmation as Attorney"
206,7,"General. In January 2017 testimony during his confirmation hearing, Sessions stated in response"
206,8,to a question about Trump Campaign communications with the Russian government that he had
206,9,"""been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have - did not have"
206,10,"communications with the Russians."" In written responses submitted on January 17, 2017, Sessions"
206,11,"answered ""[n]o"" to a question asking whether he had ""been in contact with anyone connected to"
206,12,"any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day."""
206,13,"And, in a March 2017 supplement to his testimony , Sessions identified two of the campaign-period"
206,14,"contacts with Ambassador Kislyak noted above , which had been reported in the media following"
206,15,the January 2017 confirmation hearing. Sessions stated in the supplemental response that he did
206,16,"""not recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador , or any other representatives of the"
206,17,"Russian government , regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasion."""
206,18,        Although the investigation established that Sessions interacted with Kislyak on the
206,19,occasions described above and that Kislyak mentioned the presidential campaign on at least one
206,20,"occasion, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false answers to"
206,21,Russia-related questions in light of the wording and conte xt of those questions. With respect to
206,22,"Sessions ' s statements that he did ""not recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador . .."
206,23,"regarding the political campaign"" and he had not been in contact with any Russian official ""about"
206,24,"the 2016 election, "" the evidence concerning the nature of Sessions's interactions with Kislyak"
206,25,makes it plausible that Sessions did not recall discussing the campaign with Kislyak at the time of
206,26,"his statements. Similarly, while Sessions stated in his January 2017 oral testimony that he ""did"
206,27,"not have communications with Russians,"" he did so in response to a question that had linked such"
206,28,"communications to an alleged ""continuing exchange of information "" between the Trump"
206,29,Campaign and Russian government intermediaries . Sessions later explained to the Senate and to
206,30,the Office that he understood the question as narrowly calling for disclosure of interactions with
206,31,"Russians that involved the exchange of campaign information, as distinguished from more routine"
206,32,"contacts with Russian nationals. Given the context in which the question was asked, that"
206,33,understanding is plausible.
206,34,"        Accordingly, the Office concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Session s"
206,35,was willfully untruthful in his answers and thus insufficient to obtain or sustain a conviction for
206,36,"perjury or false statements. Consistent with the Principles of Federal Prosecution , the Office"
206,37,therefore determined not to pursue charges against Sessions and informed his counsel of that
206,38,decision in March 2018.

213,4,"          This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c), which"
213,5,"states that, "" [a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel's work, he ... shall provide the Attorney"
213,6,General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions [the Special
213,7,"Counsel] reached ."""
213,8,"          Beginning in 2017, the President of the United States took a variety of actions towards the"
213,9,ongoing FBI investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and related
213,10,matters that raised questions about whether he had obstructed justice. The Order appointing the
213,11,Special Counsel gave this Office jurisdiction to investigate matters that arose directly from the
213,12,"FBI's Russia inve stigation , including whether the President had obstructed justice in connection"
213,13,with Russia-related investigations. The Special Counsel's jurisdiction also covered potentially
213,14,obstructive acts related to the Special Counsel's investigation itself. This Volume of our report
213,15,summarizes our obstruction-of-justice investigation of the President.
213,16,"          We first describe the considerations that guided our obstruction-of-justice       investigation,"
213,17,and then provide an overview of this Volume:
213,18,"          First, a traditional prosecution or declination decision entails a binary determination to"
213,19," initiate or declin e a prosecution, but we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial"
213,20,"judgment. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion finding that ""t he indictment"
213,21,or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the
213,22,"executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions"" in violation of ""the"
213,23,"constitutional separation of powers."" 1 Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the"
213,24,"Department of Justice and the framework of the Special Counsel regulations , see 28 U.S.C. § 515;"
213,25,"28 C.F .R. § 600.7(a), this Office accepted OLC's legal conclusion for the purpose of exerc ising"
213,26,"prosecutorial jurisdiction. And apart from OLC's constitutional view, we recognized that a federal"
213,27,criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President's capacity to
213,28,govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct. 2
213,29,"          Second, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be prosecuted,"
213,30, it recognizes that a cr iminal investigation during the President's term is permissible .3 The OLC
213,31,opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves office. 4 And if
213,32," individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at"
213,33,"this time. Given tho se considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public intere st in"

214,3,"safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system , we conducted a thorough factual"
214,4,investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary
214,5,materials were available.
214,6,"          Third, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under the Justice"
214,7,"Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions, but we determined not to apply"
214,8,an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes. The
214,9,threshold step under the Justice Manual standards is to assess whether a person's conduct
214,10,"""constitutes a federal offense."" U.S. Dep't of Justice, Justice Manual§ 9-27.220 (2018) (Justice"
214,11,Manual). Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges
214,12,can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a
214,13,"speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An"
214,14,individual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In
214,15,"contrast , a prosecutor's judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought ,"
214,16,affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator .5
214,17,         The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case
214,18,"of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor's accusation of a crime, even in an internal report ,"
214,19,could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice. OLC noted similar
214,20,"concerns about sealed indictments. Even if an indictment were sealed during the President's term ,"
214,21,"OLC reasoned, ""it would be very difficult to preserve [an indictment 's] secrecy, "" and if an"
214,22,"indictment became public, ""[t]he stigma and opprobrium"" could imperil the President's ability to"
214,23,"govern."" 6 Although a prosecutor's internal report would not represent a formal public accusation"
214,24,"akin to an indictment, the possibility of the report 's public disclosure and the absence of a neutral"
214,25,"adjudicatory forum to review its findings counseled against potentially determining ""that the"
214,26,"person's conduct constitutes a federal offense ."" Justice Manual § 9-27.220."

215,4,                                EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME           II
215,5,         Our obstruction -of-justice inquiry focused on a series of actions by the President that
215,6,"related to the Russian -interference investigations , including the President's conduct towards the"
215,7,law enforcement officials overseeing the investigations and the witnesses to relevant events.
215,8,                    FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION
215,9,         The key issues and events we examined include the following:
215,10,         The Campaign's response to reports about Russian support for Trump. During the 2016
215,11,"presidential campaign , questions arose about the Russian government's apparent support for"
215,12,candidate Trump. After WikiLeaks released politically damaging Democratic Party emails that
215,13,"were reported to have been hacked by Russia, Trump publicly expressed skepticism that Russia"
215,14,was responsible for the hacks at the same time that he and other Campaign officials privately
215,15,sought information                                            about any further planned WikiLeaks
215,16,"releases. Trump also denied having any business in or connections to Russia, even though as late"
215,17,as June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a licensing deal for a skyscraper to be
215,18,"built in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow. After the election , the President expressed concerns"
215,19,to advisors that reports of Russia's election interference might lead the public to question the
215,20,legitimacy of his election .
215,21,"         Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and Michael Flynn. In mid-January 2017,"
215,22,"incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn falsely denied to the Vice President, other"
215,23,"administration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak"
215,24,"about Russia ' s response to U.S. sanctions on Russia for its election interference. On January 27,"
215,25,the day after the President was told that Flynn had lied to the Vice President and had made similar
215,26,"statements to the FBI, the President invited FBI Director Corney to a private dinner at the White"
215,27,"House and told Corney that he needed loyalty. On February 14, the day after the President"
215,28,"requested Flynn's resignation, the President told an outside advisor, ""Now that we fired Flynn , the"
215,29,"Russia thing is over."" The advisor disagreed and said the investigations would continue."
215,30,"         Later that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one meeting"
215,31,"with Corney. Referring to the FBI's investigation of Flynn, the President said , ""I hope you can"
215,32,"see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy . T hope you can let this"
215,33,"go."" Shortly after requesting Flynn's resignation and speaking privately to Corney, the President"
215,34,sought to have Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland draft an internal letter stating
215,35,that the President had not directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak. McFarland declined
215,36,"because she did not know whether that was true, and a White House Counsel's Office attorney"
215,37,thought that the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorship she had been offered.
215,38,"         The President's reaction to the continuing Russia investigation. Tn February 2017,"
215,39,Attorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whether he had to recuse himself from campaign-
215,40,"related investigations because of his role in the Trump Campaign . Tn early March, the President"
215,41,told White House Counsel Donald McGahn to stop Sessions from recusing. And after Sessions
215,42,"announced his recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at the decision and told advisors"
215,43,"that he should have an Attorney General who would protect him. That weekend, the President"
215,44,"took Sessions aside at an event and urged him to ""unrecuse."" Later in March, Corney publicly"

216,3,"disclosed at a congressional hearing that the FBI was investigating ""the Russian government's"
216,4,"efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,"" including any links or coordination between"
216,5,"the Russian government and the Trump Campaign . In the following days , the President reached"
216,6,out to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency
216,7,(CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask them what they could do to publicly dispel
216,8,the suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort.
216,9,"The President also twice called Corney directly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahn to avoid"
216,10,direct contacts with the Department of Justice. Corney had previously assured the President that
216,11,"the FBI was not investigating him personally, and the President asked Corney to "" lift the cloud """
216,12,of the Russia investigation by saying that publicly.
216,13,"         The President's termination of Comey. On May 3, 2017, Corney testified in a"
216,14,"congressional hearing, but declined to answer questions about whether the President was"
216,15,"personally under investigation. Within days, the President decided to terminate Corney. The"
216,16,"President insisted that the termination letter, which was written for public release , state that Corney"
216,17,"had informed the President that he was not under investigation. The day of the firing, the White"
216,18,House maintained that Corney's termination resulted from independent recommendations from the
216,19,Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General that Corney should be discharged for mishandling
216,20,the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But the President had decided to fire Corney before
216,21,"hearing from the Department of Justice. The day after firing Corney , the President told Russian"
216,22,"officials that he had ""faced great pressure because of Russia, "" which had been ""taken off' by"
216,23,"Corney's firing. The next day , the President acknowledged in a television interview that he was"
216,24,going to fire Corney regardless of the Department of Justice's recommendation and that when he
216,25,"""decided to just do it,"" he was thinking that ""this thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story."""
216,26,"In response to a question about whether he was angry with Corney about the Russia investigation,"
216,27,"the President said, ""As far as I'm concerned , I want that thing to be absolutely done properly ,"""
216,28,"adding that firing Corney ""might even lengthen out the investigation."""
216,29,"         The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him. On May 17, 2017 , the"
216,30,Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation appointed a Special Counsel to conduct the
216,31,investigation and related matter s. The President reacted to news that a Special Counsel had been
216,32,"appointed by telling advisors that it was ""the end of his presidency"" and demanding that Sessions"
216,33,"resign. Sessions submitted his resignation , but the President ultimately did not accept it. The"
216,34,President told aides that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special
216,35,Counsel therefore could not serve. The President's advisors told him the asserted conflicts were
216,36,meritless and had already been considered by the Department of Justice.
216,37,"         On June 14, 2017, the media report ed that the Special Counsel's Office was investigating"
216,38,"whether the President had obstructed justice. Press reports called this ""a major turning point "" in"
216,39,"the investigation: while Corney had told the President he was not under investigation , following"
216,40,"Corney's firing , the President now was under investigation. The President reacted to this news"
216,41,with a series of tweets criticizing the Department of Justice and the Special Counsel's
216,42,"investigation. On June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn at home and directed him to call"
216,43,the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be
216,44,"removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction , however, deciding that he would resign rather"
216,45,than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.

217,3,         Efforts to curtail the Special Counsel's investigation. Two days after directing McGahn
217,4,"to have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attempt to affect the course of"
217,5,"the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017 , the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with"
217,6,"his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and"
217,7,dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions. The message said that Sessions should
217,8,"publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation , the investigation"
217,9,"was ""very unfair "" to the President, the President had done nothing wrong , and Sessions planned to"
217,10,"meet with the Special Counsel and ""let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling"
217,11,"for future elections."" Lewandowski said he understood what the Presid ent wanted Sessions to do."
217,12,"          One month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017 , the"
217,13,President asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel
217,14,investigation to future election interference. Lewandowski told the President that the message
217,15,"would be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an"
217,16,"interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that"
217,17,Sessions's job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President's message
217,18,"personally , so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions."
217,19,Dearborn was uncomforta ble with the task and did not follow through.
217,20,"          Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence. In the summer of 2017 , the President"
217,21,"learned that media outlets were asking questions about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower"
217,22,"between senior campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer who was"
217,23,"said to be offering damaging information about Hillary Clinton as ""part of Russia and its"
217,24,"government's support for Mr. Trump."" On several occasions, the President directed aides not to"
217,25,"publicly disclose the emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not"
217,26,leak and that the number of lawyers with access to them should be limited. Before the emails
217,27,"became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr. by deleting a line that"
217,28,"acknowledged that the meeting was with ""an individual who [Trump Jr.] was told might have"
217,29,"information helpful to the campaign"" and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions"
217,30,of Russian children. When the press asked questions about the President ' s involvement in Trump
217,31,"Jr.' s statement, the President's personal lawyer repeatedly denied the President had played any"
217,32,role.
217,33,          Further efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation. In early
217,34,"summer 2017 , the President called Sessions at home and again asked him to reverse his recusal"
217,35,"from the Russia investigation. Sessions did not reverse his recusal. In October 2017 , the President"
217,36,"met privately with Sess ions in the Oval Office and asked him to ""take [a] look"" at investigating"
217,37,"Clinton. In December 2017 , shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation"
217,38,"agreement, the President met with Sessions in the Oval Office and sugges ted, according to notes"
217,39,"taken by a senior advisor, that if Sessio ns unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia"
217,40,"inve stigation, he would be a ""hero."" The President told Sess ions, ""I'm not going to do anything"
217,41,"or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly."" In response , Sessions volunteered"
217,42,"that he had never seen anything ""improper "" on the campaign and told the President there was a"
217,43,"""w hole new leadership team"" in place. He did not unrecuse."
217,44,          Efforts to have McGahn deny that the President had ordered him to have the Special
217,45,"Counsel removed. In early 2018, the press reported that the President had directed McGahn to"

218,3,have the Special Counsel removed in June 2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather
218,4,than carry out the order. The President reacted to the news stories by directing White House
218,5,officials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to
218,6,have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn told those officials that the media reports were
218,7,accurate in stating that the President had directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed.
218,8,The President then met with McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the
218,9,"reports. In the same meeting , the President also asked McGahn why he had told the Special"
218,10,Counsel about the President ' s effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahn took notes
218,11,of his conversations with the President. McGahn refused to back away from what he remembered
218,12,happening and perceived the President to be testing his mettle.
218,13,"         Conduct towards Flynn, Manafort,~.                 After Flynn withdrew from a joint defen se"
218,14,"agreement with the President and began coop erating with the government, the President ' s personal"
218,15,counsel left a message for Flynn ' s attorneys reminding them of the President 's warm feelings
218,16,"towards Flynn, which he said ""still remains,"" and asking for a ""heads up"" if Flynn knew"
218,17,"""information that implicates the President."" When Flynn ' s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no"
218,18,"longer share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President's personal counsel"
218,19,"said he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn 's actions reflected ""hostility"" towards"
218,20,the President. During Manafort ' s prosecution and when the jury in his criminal. trial was
218,21,"deliberating , the President praised Manafort in public, said that Manafort was being treated"
218,22,"unfairly, and declined to rule out a pardon. After Manafort was convicted, the President called"
218,23,"Manafort ""a brave man"" for refusin to ""break"" and said that ""fli in "" ""almost ou ht to be"
218,24,"         Conduct involving Michael Cohen. The President ' s conduct towards Michael Cohen , a"
218,25,"former Trump Organization executive, changed from praise for Cohen when he falsely minimized"
218,26,"the President's involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project , to castigation of Cohen when"
218,27,"he became a cooperating witness. From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the"
218,28,Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf of the Trump Organization and had briefed candidate
218,29,"Trump on the project numerous times , including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia"
218,30,"to advance the deal. In 2017 , Cohen provided false testimony to Congress about the project,"
218,31,including stating that he had only briefed Trump on the project three times and never discussed
218,32,"travel to Russia with him, in an effort to adhere to a ""party line"" that Cohen said was developed to"
218,33,"minimize the President's connections to Russia. While preparing for his congressional testimony ,"
218,34,"Cohen had extensive discussions with the President 's personal counsel, who , according to Cohen ,"
218,35,"said that Cohen should ""stay on message"" and not contradict the President. After the FBI searched"
218,36,"Cohen's home and office in April 2018 , the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not"
218,37,"""flip,"" contacted him directly to tell him to ""stay strong,"" and privately passed messages of support"
218,38,to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President's personal counsel and believed that if
218,39,he stayed on message he would be taken care of. But after Cohen began cooperating with the
218,40,"government in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a ""rat ,"" and"
218,41,suggested that his family memb ers had committed crimes.

219,3,          Overarching factual issues. We did not make a traditional prosecution decision about
219,4,"these facts, but the evidence we obtained supports several general statements about the President ' s"
219,5,conduct.
219,6,          Several features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical obstruction-of-
219,7,"justice cases. First, the investigation concerned the President , and some of his actions , such as"
219,8," firing the FBI director , involved facially lawful acts within his Article II authority, which raises"
219,9,"constitutional issues discussed below. At the same time , the President's position as the head of"
219,10,the Executive Branch provided him with unique and powerful mean s of influencing official
219,11,"proceedings, subordinate officers , and potential witnesses-all       of which is relevant to a potential"
219,12,"obstruction-of-justice analysis. Second , unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of"
219,13,"justice to cover up a crime , the evidence we obtained did not establish that the Pre sident was"
219,14, involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. Although the obstruction
219,15," statutes do not require proof of such a crime, the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of"
219,16,"the President's intent and requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct. Th ird ,"
219,17," many of the President's acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with"
219,18,"the government and suggestions of possible future pardons , took place in public view. That"
219,19,"circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the reach of the"
219,20,"obstruction laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influ ence witnesses or alter their testimony,"
219,21,the harm to the justice system's integrity is the same.
219,22,"          Although the series of events we investigated involved discrete acts , the overall patt ern of"
219,23,the President's conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of the President ' s
219,24,"acts and the inferences that can be drawn about his intent. In particular, the actions we investigated"
219,25,"can be divided into two phases , reflecting a possible shift in the President's motives. The first"
219,26,phase covered the period from the President ' s first interactions with Corney through the President 's
219,27," firing of Corney. During that time , the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally"
219,28,"under investigation. Soon after the firing of Corney and the appointment of the Special Counsel,"
219,29,"however, the President became aware that his own conduct was being investigat ed in an"
219,30,"obstruction-of-justice inquiry. At that point , the Presid ent engaged in a second phase of conduct,"
219,31," involving public attacks on the inve~tigation , non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both"
219,32, public and private to encourage witne sses not to cooperate with the investigation. Judgments about
219,33,the nature of the President 's motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the
219,34,evidence.
219,35,                            STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSES
219,36,          The President's coun se l raised statutory and constitutional defenses to a possible
219,37, obstruction-of-justice analysis of the conduct we investigated. We concluded that none of those
219,38, legal defenses provided a basis for declining to investigate the facts.
219,39,          Statutory defenses. Consistent with precedent and the Department of Justice's general
219,40," approach to interpreting obstruction statutes , we concluded that several statutes could apply here."
219,41,"See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503 , 1505 , 1512(b)(3) , 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) is an omnibus"
219,42, obstruction-of-justice provision that covers a range of obstructive acts directed at pending or
219,43, contemplated official proceedings . No principle of statutory construction justifies narrowing the
219,44, provision to cover only conduct that impair s the integrity or availability of evidence. Sections
219,45,"  1503 and 1505 also offer broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury ,"

220,5,to law enforcement of information related to a federal crime.
220,6,          Constitutional defenses. As for constitutional defenses arising from the President's status
220,7,"as the head of the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the courts"
220,8,have not . definitively resolved these issues. We therefore examined those issues through the
220,9,framework established by Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues. The
220,10,Department of Justice and the President's personal counsel have recognized that the President is
220,11,subject to statutes that prohibit obstruction of justice by bribing a witness or suborning perjury
220,12,because that conduct does not implicate his constitutional authority. With respect to whether the
220,13,"President ca,n be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the"
220,14,"Constitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his"
220,15,authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice .
220,16,"         Under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and"
220,17,permanently immunize a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II powers .
220,18,"The separation-of-powers doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official proceedings, including"
220,19,"those of courts and grand juries, from corrupt, obstructive acts regard less of their source. We also"
220,20,concluded that any inroad on presidential authority that would occur from prohibiting corrupt acts
220,21,does not undermine the President's ability to fulfill his constitutional mission. The term
220,22,"""corruptly "" sets a demanding standard. It requires a concrete showing that a person acted with an"
220,23," intent to obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official duty"
220,24,"and the rights ofothers. A preclusion of""corrupt"" official action does not diminish the President's"
220,25,"ability to exercise Article II powers. For example , the proper supervision of criminal law does not"
220,26,demand freedom for the President to act with a corrupt intention of shielding himself from criminal
220,27,"punishment , avoiding financial liability, or preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary ,"
220,28,"a statute that prohibits official action undertaken for such corrupt purposes furthers, rather than"
220,29," hinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law. It also aligns with the President's"
220,30,"constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws. Finally, we concluded that in the rare case in"
220,31,"which a criminal investigation of the President ' s conduct is justified, inquiries to determine"
220,32,whether the President acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance
220,33,of his constitutionally assigned duties . The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction
220,34, laws to the President ' s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional
220,35, system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law .
220,36,                                             CONCLUSION
220,37,"          Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment , we did not draw"
220,38, ultimate conclusions about the President ' s conduct. The evidence we obtained about the
220,39,President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were
220,40," making a traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a"
220,41,"thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice,"
220,42,"we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach"
220,43,"that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a"
220,44," crime, it also does not exonerate him."

221,4,I.  BACKGROUND LEGAL AND EVIDENTIARY PRINCIPLES
221,5,         A.      Legal Framework of Obstruction of Justice
221,6,"         The May 17, 2017 Appointment Order and the Special Counsel regulations provide this"
221,7,"Office with jurisdiction to investigate ""federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent"
221,8,"to interfere with, the Special Counsel's investigation , such as perjury , obstruction of justice,"
221,9,"destruction of evidence , and intimidation of witnesses."" 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a) . Because of that"
221,10,"description of our jurisdiction, we sought evidence for our obstruction-of-justice investigation with"
221,11,the elements of obstruction offenses in mind. Our evidentiary analysis is similarly focused on the
221,12,"elements of such offenses, although we do not draw conclusions on the ultimate questions that"
221,13,govern a prosecutorial decision under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual
221,14, § 9-27.000 et seq. (2018).
221,15,"         Here, we summarize the law interpreting the elements of potentially relevant obstruction"
221,16,statutes in an ordinary case. This discussion does not address the unique constitutional issues that
221,17,arise in an inquiry into official acts by the Pre sident. Those issues are discussed in a later section
221,18,of this report addressing constitutional defenses that the President ' s counsel have raised. See
221,19,"Volume II, Section III.B, irifra."
221,20,         Three basic elements are common to most of the relevant obstruction statutes: ( 1) an
221,21,obstructive act; (2) a nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and (3) a corrupt
221,22," intent. See, e.g. , 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505, 1512(c)(2). We describe those elements as they have '"
221,23,"been interpreted by the courts. We then discuss a more specific statute aimed at witness tampering,"
221,24,"see 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b), and describe the requirement s for attempt ed offenses and endeavors to"
221,25,"obstruct justice , see 18 U.S.C . §§ I 503, 1512(c)(2)."
221,26,"         Obstructive act. Obstruction-of-justice law ""reaches all corrupt conduct capable of"
221,27,"producing an effect that prevents justice from being duly administered, regardless of the means"
221,28,"employed."" United States v. Silverman, 745 F.2d 1386, 1393 (11th Cir. 1984) (interpreting 18"
221,29,"U .S.C. § 1503). An "" effort to influence"" a proceeding can qualify as an endeavor to obstruct"
221,30,"justice even if the effort was ""subtle or circuitous"" and ""however cleverly or with whatever"
221,31,"cloaking of purpose "" it was made. United States v. Roe, 529 F.2d 629,632 (4th Cir. 1975); see"
221,32,"also United States v. Quattrone, 441 F.3d 153, 173 (2d Cir. 2006). The verbs '"" obstruct or impede'"
221,33,"are broad"" and ""can refer to anything that blocks, makes difficult , or hinder s ."" Marinello v. United"
221,34,"States , 138 S. Ct. 1101, 1106 (2018) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted)."
221,35,         An improper motive can render an actor's conduct criminal even when the conduct would
221,36,"otherwise be lawful and within the actor's authority. See United States v. Cueto, 151 F .3d 620,"
221,37,"631 (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming obstruction conviction of a criminal defense attorney for ""litigation-"
221,38,"related conduct""); United States v. Cintolo, 818 F .2d 980, 992 (1st Cir. 1987) (""any act by any"
221,39,party-whether lawful or unlawful on its face-may abridge § 1503 if performed with a corrupt
221,40,"motive"")."
221,41,         Nexus to a pending or contemplated official proceeding. Obstruction-of-justice law
221,42,"generally requires a nexus, or connection, to an official proceeding. In Section 1503 , the nexus"
221,43,"must be to pending ""judicial or grand jury proceedings. "" United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593,"

222,4,"599 (1995). In Section 1505, the nexus can include a connection to a ""pending"" federal agency"
222,5,"proceeding or a congressional inquiry or investigation. Under both statutes, the government must"
222,6,"demonstrate "" a relationship in time, causation , or logic "" between the obstructive act and the"
222,7,"proceeding or inquiry to be obstructed. Id. at 599; see also Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States,"
222,8,"544 U.S. 696 , 707- 708 (2005). Section I 5 I 2(c) prohibits obstructive efforts aimed at official"

222,11,"at the time of the offense."" 18 U.S.C . § 15 l 2(f)(l ). Although a proceeding need not already be in"
222,12,"progress to trigger liability under Section 1512(c), a nexus to a contemplated proceeding still must"
222,13,"be shown. United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019); United States v. Petruk, 781"
222,14,"F.3d 438 , 445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips , 583 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009);"

224,13,"         After the appointment of the Specia l Counsel, this Office obtained evidence about the"
224,14,following events relating to potential issues of obstruction of justice involving the President:
224,15,"      (a) The President 's January 27, 2017 dinner with former FBI Director James Corney in which"
224,16,"           the President reportedly asked for Corney's loyalty , one day after the White House had"
224,17,           been briefed by the Department of Justice on contacts between former National Security
224,18,           Advisor Michael Flynn and the Russian Ambassador;
224,19,"      (b) The President's February 14, 2017 meeting with Corney in which the President reportedly"
224,20,           asked Corney not to pursue an investigation of Flynn;
224,21,      (c) The President's private requests to Corney to make public the fact that the President was
224,22,           not the subject of an FBI investigation and to lift what the President regarded as a cloud;
224,23,      (d) The President ' s outreach to the Director of National Intelligence and the Directors of the
224,24,           National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency about the FBI 's Russia
224,25,           investigation ;
224,26,"      (e) The President's stated rationales for terminating Corney on May 9, 2017, including"
224,27,           statements that could reasonably be understood as acknowledging that the FBT's Russia
224,28,           investigation was a factor in Corney's termination; and
224,29,"      (f) The President's reported involvement in issuing a statement about the June 9, 2016 Trump"
224,30,           Tower meeting between Russians and senior Trump Campaign officials that said the
224,31,           meeting was about adoption and omitted that the Russians had offered to provide the
224,32,           Trump Campaign with derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.
224,33,Taking into account that information and our analysis of applicable statutory and constitutional
224,34,"principle s (discussed below in Volume II, Section III, infra), we determined that there was a"
224,35,sufficient factual and legal basis to further investigate potential obstruction-of -justice issues
224,36,involving the President.
224,37,          Many of the core issues in an obstruction-of-justice investigation turn on an individual ' s
224,38,actions and intent. We therefore requested that the White House provide us with documentary
224,39,evidence in its possession on the relevant events. We also sought and obtained the White House's

225,3,"voluntary basis when possible, and used legal process where appropriate. These investigative steps"
225,4,allowed us to gather a substantial amount of evidence.
225,5,         We also sought a voluntary interview with the President. After more
225,6,"discussion, the President declined to be interviewed."
225,7,"                                                                During the course of our discussions,"
225,8,"the President did agree to answer written questions on certain Russia-related topics , and he"
225,9,provided us with answers. He did not similarly agree to provide written answers to questions on
225,10,"obstruction topics or questions on events during the transition. Ultimately, while we believed that"
225,11,we had the authority and legal justification to issue a grand jury subpoena to obtain the President 's
225,12,"testimony, we chose not to do so. We made that decision in view of the substantial delay that such"
225,13,an investigative step wou ld likely produce at a late stage in our investigation. We also assessed
225,14,that based on the significant body of evidence we had already obtained of the President's actions
225,15,"and his public and private statements describing or explaining those actions , we had sufficient"
225,16,evidence to understand relevant events and to make certain assessments without the President's
225,17,testimony. The Office's decision-making process on this issue is described in more detail in
225,18,"Appendix C, infra, in a note that precedes the President ' s written responses."
225,19,"         In assessing the evidence we obtained, we relied on common principles that apply in any"
225,20,"investigation. The issue of criminal intent is often inferred from circumstantial evidence. See,"
225,21,"e.g., United States v. Croteau, 819 F.3d 1293, 1305 (I Ith Cir. 2016) (""[G]uilty knowledge can"
225,22,"rarely be established by direct evidence .... Therefore, mens rea elements such as knowledge or"
225,23,"intent may be proved by circumstantial evidence."") (internal quotation marks omitted); United"
225,24,"States v. Robinson , 702 F.3d 22, 36 (2d Cir. 2012) (""The government's case rested on"
225,25,"circumstantial evidence, but the mens rea elements of knowledge and intent can often be proved"
225,26,"through circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. "" ) (internal"
225,27,quotation marks omitted) . The principle that intent can be inferred from circumstantial evidence
225,28,"is a necessity in criminal cases, given the right ofa subject to assert his priv ilege against compelled"
225,29,"self-incr imination under the Fifth Amendment and therefore decline to testify. Accordingly,"
225,30,determinations on intent are frequently reached without the opportunity to interview an
225,31,investigatory subject.
225,32,"         Obstruction-of -justice cases are consistent with this rule. See, e.g., Ed/ind, 887 F.3d at"
225,33,"174, 176 (relying on ""s ignificant circumstantial evidence that [the defendant] wa s conscious of her"
225,34,"wrongdoing"" in an obstruction case; ""[b]ecause evidence of intent will almost always be"
225,35,"circumstantial , a defendant may be found culpab le where the reasonable and foreseeable"
225,36,"consequences of her act s are the obstruction of justice "") (internal quotation marks, ellipses, and"
225,37,"punctuation omitted) ; Quattrone, 441 F.3d at 173-174. Circumstantial evidence that illuminates"
225,38,"intent may include a patt ern of potentially obstruc tive acts. Fed. R. Evid. 404(6) (""Evidence of a"
225,39,"crime, wrong, or other act ... may be admissible . . . [to] prov[ e] motive , opportunity , intent,"
225,40,"preparation , plan, knowledge , identity , absence of mistake, or lack of accident. ""); see, e.g., United"
225,41,"States v. Frankhauser , 80 F .3d 641 , 648-650 ( I st Cir. 1996); United States v. Arnold , 773 F .2d"

225,43,         Credibility judgments may also be made bas ed on objective facts and circumstantial
225,44,evidence. Standard jury instru ct ions highlight a variety of factors that are often relevant in

226,3,assessing credibility. These include whether a witness had a reason not to tell the truth ; whether
226,4,the witness had a good memory; whether the witness had the opportunity to observe the events
226,5,about which he testified ; whether the witness ' s testimony was corroborated by other witne sses;
226,6,"and whether anything the witness said or wrote previously contradicts his testimony. See, e.g.,"
226,7,First Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions § 1.06 (2018); Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions
226,8,(Criminal Cases) § 1.08 (2012); Seventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction § 3.0 l (2012).
226,9,"         In addition to those general factors , we took into account more specific factors in assessing"
226,10,"the credibility of conflicting accounts of the facts. For example , contemporaneous written notes"
226,11,"can provide strong corroborating evidence. See United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 , 232 (1975)"
226,12,"(the fact that a ""statement appeared in the contemporaneously recorded report ... would tend"
226,13,"strongly to corroborate the investigator's version of the interview"") . Similarly , a witness's"
226,14,recitation of his account before he had any motive to fabricate also supports the witne ss ' s
226,15,"credibility. See Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 158 (l 995) ("" A con sistent statement that"
226,16,predates the motive is a square rebuttal of the charge that the testimony was contrived as a

226,18,"consciousness of wrongdoing. See Al-Adahi v. Obama, 613 F.3d 1102, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2010)"

227,4,II. FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION
227,5,         This section of the report details the evidence we obtained. We first provide an overview
227,6,"of how Russia became an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign , and how candidate Trump"
227,7,responded. We then tum to the key events that we investigated: the President's conduct concerning
227,8,the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn; the President's reaction to public confirmation of the FBI ' s
227,9,Russia investigation; events leading up to and surrounding the termination of FBI Director Corney;
227,10,efforts to terminate the Special Counsel; efforts to curtail the scope of the Special Counsel's
227,11,"investigation; efforts to prevent disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower"
227,12,meeting between Russians and senior campaign officials; efforts to have the Attorney General
227,13,"unrecuse; and conduct towards McGahn, Cohen, and other witnesses."
227,14,         We summarize the evidence we found and then analyze it by reference to the three statutory
227,15,"obstruction-of-justice elements: obstructive act , nexus to a proceeding , and intent. We focus on"
227,16,"elements because , by regulation, the Special Counsel has ""jurisdiction .. . to investigate ... federal"
227,17,"crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel ' s"
227,18,"investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice , destruction of evidence, and intimidation of"
227,19,"witnesses. "" 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).             Consistent with our jurisdiction to investigate federal"
227,20,"obstruction crimes, we gathered evidence that is relevant to the elements of thos e crimes and"
227,21,analyzed them within an elements framework-while                     refraining from reaching ultimate
227,22,"conclusions about whether crimes were committed , for the reasons explained above. This section"
227,23,also does not address legal and constitutional defenses raised by counsel for the President; those
227,24,"defenses are analyzed in Volume II , Section III, iefra."
227,25,         A.       The Campaign's Response to Reports About Russian Support for Trump
227,26,"         During the 2016 campaign , the media raised questions about a possible connection between"
227,27,the Trump Campaign and Russia .7 The questions intensified after WikiLeaks released politically
227,28,damaging Democratic Party emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia. Trump
227,29,responded to questions about possible connections to Russia by denying any business involvement
227,30,in Russia-even      though the Trump Organization had pursued a business project in Russia as late
227,31,as June 2016. Trump also expressed skepticism that Russia had hacked the emails at the same
227,32,time as he and other Campaign advisors privately sought information                                 about any
227,33,"further planned WikiLeaks releases. After the election , when questions persisted about possible"
227,34,"links between Russia and the Trump Campaign, the President-Elect continued to deny any"
227,35,connections to Russia and privately expressed concerns that reports of Russian election
227,36,interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his election .8

227,38,            This section summarizes and cites various news stories not for the truth of the information
227,39,"contained in the stories, but rather to place candidate Trump' s response to those stories in context. Volume"
227,40,I of this report analyzes the underlying facts of several relevant events that were reported on by the media
227,41,during the campaign.

227,43,"            As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals"
227,44,"with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence"
227,45,was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with
227,46,representatives ofthe Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.

228,4,"         On June 16, 2015, Donald J. Trump declared his intent to seek nomination as the"
228,5,"Republican candidate for President. 9 By early 2016, he distinguished himself among Republican"
228,6,"candidates by speaking of closer ties with Russia, 10 saying he would get along well with Russian"
228,7,"President Vladimir Putin, 11 questioning whether the NATO alliance was obsolete, 12 and praising"
228,8,"Putin as a ""strong leader."" 13 The press reported that Russian political analysts and commentators"
228,9,perceived Trump as favorable .to Russia. 14
228,10,"         Beginning in February 2016 and continuing through the summer, the media reported that"
228,11,"several Trump campaign advisors appeared to have ties to Russia. For example , the press reported"
228,12,that campaign advisor Michael Flynn was seated next to Vladimir Putin at an RT gala in Moscow
228,13,in December 2015 and that Flynn had appeared regularly on RT as an analyst. 15 The press also
228,14,"reported that foreign policy advisor Carter Page had ties to a Russian state-run gas company, 16 and"
228,15,"that campaign chairman Paul Manafort had done work for the ""Russian-backed former Ukrainian"

236,3,        B.       The President's Conduct Concerning the Investigation of Michael Flynn
236,4,                                                 Overview
236,5,"        During the presidential transition, incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had"
236,6,two phone calls with the Russian Ambassador to the United States about the Russian response to
236,7,U.S. sanctions imposed because of Russia's election interference. After the press reported on
236,8,"Flynn's contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Flynn lied to incoming Administration officials"
236,9,by saying he had not discussed sanctions on the calls . The officials publicly repeated those lies in
236,10,"press interviews.      The FBI, which previously was investigating Flynn for other matters,"
236,11,"interviewed him about the calls in the first week after the inauguration, and Flynn told similar lies"
236,12,"to the FBI. On January 26, 2017, Department of Justice (DOJ) officials notified the White House"
236,13,that Flynn and the Russian Ambassador had discussed sanctions and that Flynn had been
236,14,"interviewed by the FBT. The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James"
236,15,"Corney in which he asked for Corney's loyalty. On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn"
236,16,"to resign. The following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Corney in which"
236,17,"he said, ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go."""

236,20,                     Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak
236,21,"        Shortly after the election, President-Elect Trump announced he would appoint Michael"
236,22,"Flynn as his National Security Advisor. 78 For the next two months, Flynn played an active role on"
236,23,the Presidential Transition Team (PTT) coordinating policy positions and communicating with
236,24,"foreign government officials, including Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey"
236,25,Kislyak. 79
236,26,"        On December 29 , 2016, as noted in Volume II, Section TT.A.4, supra, the Obama"
236,27,Administration announced that it was imposing sanctions and other measures on several Russian
236,28,"individuals and entities. 80 That day, multiple members of the PTT exchanged emails about the"
236,29,"sanctions and the impact they would have on the incoming Administration, and Flynn informed"
236,30,members of the PTT that he would be speaking to the Russian Ambassador later in the day. 81

237,3,"Flynn, who was in the Dominican Republic at the time, and K.T. McFarland, who was slated to"
237,4,become the Deputy National Security Advisor and was at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with
237,5,"the President-Elect and other senior staff, talked by phone about what, if anything, Flynn should"
237,6,communicate to Kislyak about the sanctions .82                 McFarland had spoken with incoming
237,7,Administration officials about the sanctions and Russia ' s possible responses and thought she had
237,8,mentioned in those conversations that Flynn was scheduled to speak with Kislyak. 83 Based on
237,9,"those conversations, McFarland informed Flynn that incoming Administration officials at Mar-a-"
237,10,"Lago did not want Russia to escalate the situation. 84 At 4:43 p.m. that afternoon, McFarland sent"
237,11,"an email to several officials about the sanctions and informed the group that ""Gen [F]lynn is talking"

237,13,"         Approximately one hour later, McFarland met with the President-Elect and senior officials"
237,14,and briefed them on the sanctions and Russia's possible responses. 86 Incoming Chief of Staff
237,15,Reince Priebus recalled that McFarland may have mentioned at the meeting that the sanctions
237,16,"situation could be ""cooled down"" and not escalated. 87 McFarland recalled that at the end of the"
237,17,"meeting, someone may have mentioned to the President-Elect that Flynn was speaking to the"
237,18,Russian Ambassador that evening. 88 McFarland did not recall any response by the President-
237,19,Elect.89 Priebus recalled that the President-Elect viewed the sanctions as an attempt by the Obama
237,20,Administration to embarrass him by delegitimizing his election. 90
237,21,"         Immediately after discussing the sanctions with McFarland on December 29, 2016, Flynn"
237,22,"called Kislyak and requested that Russia respond to the sanctions only in a reciprocal manner,"
237,23,"without escalating the situation. 91 After the call, Flynn briefed McFarland on its substance. 92"
237,24,Flynn told McFarland that the Russian response to the sanctions was not going to be escalatory
237,25,"because Russia wanted a good relationship with the Trump Administration. 93 On December 30,"

242,9,Department of Justice assessed that the Russian government could prove Flynn lied. 135 The FBI

243,8,attorney James Burnham. 143 Yates said that the public statements made by the Vice President

243,10,compromised position because the Russians would know he had lied. 144 Yates disclosed that Flynn

245,7,"bring a Logan Act prosecution against Flynn, but stated that the White House did not want to take"
245,8,action that would interfere with an ongoing FBI investigation of Flynn. 164 Yates responded that
245,9,Department ofJustice had notified the White House so that it could take action in response to the
245,10,infonnation provided. 165 McGahn ended the meeting by asking Yates for access to the underlying

246,10,to investigate the allegations to prove they were false. 174 Corney responded that the President

248,7,"         On February 2, 2017 , Eisenberg reviewed the underlying information relating to Flynn's"
248,8,calls with Kislyak. 189 Eisenberg recalled that he prepared a memorandum about criminal statutes
248,9,"that could apply to Flynn ' s conduct, but he did not believe the White House had enough"
248,10,information to make a definitive recommendation to the President. 190 Eisenberg and McGahn
248,11,discussed that Eisenberg's review of the underlying information confirmed his preliminary
248,12,conclusion that Flynn was unlikely to be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act. I9I Because White
248,13,"House officials were uncertain what Flynn had told the FBI, however , they could not assess his"
248,14,exposure to prosecution for violating 18 U .S.C. § 1001. 192
248,15,"         The week of February 6, Flynn had a one-on-one conversation with the President in the"
248,16,Oval Office about the negative media coverage of his contacts with Kislyak. I93 Flynn recalled that
248,17,the President was upset and asked him for information on the conversations. 194 Flynn listed the
248,18,"specific dates on which he remembered speaking with Kislyak, but the President corrected one of"
248,19,the dates he listed. I95 The President asked Flynn what he and Kislyak discussed and Flynn

248,27,"that he told the President in his January 6, 2017 meeting, and on phone calls on March 30 and April 11,"
248,28,"2017, that the FBI was not investigating the President personally. On May 8, 2017, during White House"
248,29," discussions about firing Corney, the President told Rosenstein and others that Corney had told him three"

256,6,"          In analyzing the President's conduct related to the Flynn investigation,            the following"
256,7, evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:
256,8,"          a.      Obstructive act. According to Corney's account of his February 14, 2017 meeting"
256,9," in the Oval Office, the President told him, ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to"
256,10," letting Flynn go .... I hope you can let this go."" In analyzing whether these statements constitute"
256,11," an obstructive act, a threshold question is whether Corney's account of the interaction is accurate ,"
256,12," and, if so, whether the President 's statements had the tendency to impede the administration of"
256,13,justice by shutting down an inquiry that could result in a grand jury investigation and a criminal
256,14, charge.
256,15,"          After Corney's account of the President ' s request to ""let[] Flynn go"" became public, the"
256,16,President publicly disputed several aspects of the story. The President told the New York Times
256,17," that he did not ""s hoo other people out of the room"" when he talked to Corney and that he did not"
256,18, remember having a one-on-one conversation with Comey. 268 The President also publicly denied
256,19,"that he had asked Corney to ""let[] Flynn go"" or otherwise communicated that Corney should drop"
256,20,"the investigation ofFlynn. 269 In private, the President denied aspects of Corney's account to White"
256,21,"House advisors, but acknowledged to Priebus that he brought Flynn up in the meeting with Corney"
256,22,"and stated that Flynn was a good guy. 270 Despite those denials, substantial evidence corroborates"

257,3,"        First, Corney wrote a detailed memorandum of his encounter with the President on the"
257,4,same day it occurred. Corney also told senior FBI officials about the meeting with the President
257,5,"that day, and their recollections of what Corney told them at the time are consistent with Corney's"
257,6,account. 271
257,7,"        Second, Corney provided testimony about the President's request that he "" let[] Flynn go"""
257,8,under oath in congressional proceedings and in interviews with federal investigators subject to
257,9,penalties for lying under 18 U.S.C . § I 00 l . Corney's recollections of the encounter have remained
257,10,consistent over time.
257,11,"        Third, the objective , corroborated circumstances of how the one-on-one meeting came to"
257,12,occur support Corney's description of the event. Corney recalled that the President cleared the
257,13,"room to speak with Corney alone after a homeland security briefing in the Oval Office, that"
257,14,"Kushner and Sessions lingered and had to be shooed out by the President, and that Priebus briefly"
257,15,"opened the door during the meeting, prompting the President to wave him away . While the"
257,16,"President has publicly denied those details, other Administration officials who were present have"
257,17,confirmed Corney's account of how he ended up in a one-on -one meeting with the President. 272
257,18,And the President acknowledged to Priebus and McGahn that he in fact spoke to Corney about
257,19,Flynn in their one-on-one meeting.
257,20,"        Fourth, the President's decision to clear the room and, in particular , to exclude the Attorney"
257,21,"General from the meeting signals that the President wanted to be alone with Corney , which is"
257,22,"consistent with the delivery of a message of the type that Corney recalls, rather than a more"
257,23,innocuous conversation that could have occurred in the presence of the Attorney General.
257,24,"        Finally, Corney's reaction to the President's statements is consistent with the President"
257,25,"having asked him to ""let[] Flynn go."" Corney met with the FBI leadership team, which agreed to"
257,26,keep the President ' s statements closely held and not to inform the team working on the Flynn
257,27,investigation so that they would not be influenced by the President ' s request. Corney also promptly
257,28,"met with the Attorney General to ask him not to be left alone with the President again, an account"
257,29,"verified by Sessions, FBI Chief of Staff James Rybicki, and Jody Hunt, who was then the Attorney"
257,30,General's chief of staff.
257,31,"        A second question is whether the President's statements, which were not phrased as a direct"
257,32,"order to Corney, could impede or interfere with the FBI's investigation of Flynn . While the"
257,33,"President said he ""hope[d]"" Corney could ""let[] Flynn go,"" rather than affirmatively directing him"
257,34,"to do so, the circumstances of the conversation show that the President was asking Corney to close"
257,35,"the FBl's investigation into Flynn. First, the President arranged the meeting with Corney so that"
257,36,"they would be alone and purposely excluded the Attorney General, which suggests that the"
257,37,"President meant to make a request to Corney that he did not want anyone else to hear. Second ,"
257,38,"because the President is the head of the Executive Branch, when he says that he ""hope s"" a"
257,39,"subordinate will do something , it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will do what the"
257,40,"President wants. Indeed, the President repeated a version of""let this go "" three times , and Corney"

258,7,to show that the President could reasonably foresee and actually contemplated that the
258,8,investigation of Flynn was likely to lead to a grand jury investigation or prosecution.
258,9,"         At the time of the President's one-on-one meeting with Corney, no grand jury subpoenas"
258,10,had been issued as part of the FBI's investi ation into Fl nn. But Fl nn's lies to the FBI violated
258,11,"federal criminal law,                                                     , and resulted in Flynn's"
258,12,prosecution for violating 18 U .S.C. § 100 I. By the time the President spoke to Corney about
258,13,"Flynn, DOJ officials had informed McGahn , who informed the President, that Flynn ' s statements"
258,14,to senior White House officials about his contacts with Kislyak were not true and that Flynn had
258,15,told the same version of events to the FBI. McGahn also informed the President that Flynn ' s
258,16,conduct could violate 18 U.S .C. § l 001. After the Vice President and senior White House officials
258,17,"reviewed the underlying information about Flynn's calls on February 10, 2017, they believed that"
258,18,Flynn could not have forgotten his conversations with Kislyak and concluded that he had been
258,19,"lying. In addition, the President's instruction to the FBI Director to ""let[] Flynn go"" suggests his"
258,20,awareness that Flynn could face criminal exposure for his conduct and was at risk of prosecution.
258,21,"         c.       Intent. As part of our investigation, we examined whether the President had a"
258,22,"personal stake in the outcome of an investigation into Flynn-for example , whether the President"
258,23,"was aware of Flynn ' s communications with Kislyak close in time to when they occurred, such that"
258,24,the President knew that Flynn had lied to senior White House officials and that those lies had been
258,25,passed on to the public. Some evidence suggests that the President knew about the existence and
258,26,"content of Flynn's calls when they occurred, but the evidence is inconclusive and could not be"
258,27,"relied upon to establish the President's knowledge. In advance of Flynn's initial call with Kislyak ,"
258,28,the President attended a meeting where the sanctions were discussed and an advisor may have
258,29,mentioned that Flynn was scheduled to talk to Kislyak. Flynn told McFarland about the substance
258,30,"of his calls with Kislyak and said they may have made a difference in Russia's response, and Flynn"
258,31,"recalled talking to Bannon in early January 2017 about how they had successfully ""stopped the"
258,32,"train on Russia's response "" to the sanctions. It would have been reasonable for Flynn to have"
258,33,wanted the President to know of his communications with Kislyak because Kislyak told Flynn his
258,34,request had been received at the highest levels in Russia and that Russia had chosen not to retaliate
258,35," in response to the request , and the President was pleased by the Ru ssian response , calling it a"
258,36,""" [g]reat move."" And the President never said publicly or internally that Flynn had lied to him"
258,37,about the calls with Kislyak.
258,38,         But McFarland did not recall providing the President-Elect with Flynn's read-out of his
258,39,"calls with Kislyak , and Flynn does not have a specific recollection of telling the President-Elect"
258,40, directly about the calls. Bannon also said he did not recall hearing about the calls from Flynn.
258,41,"And in February 2017, the President asked Flynn what was discussed on th e calls and whether he"
258,42," had lied to the Vice President, suggesting that he did not already know. Our investigation"
258,43, accordingly did not produce evidence that established that the President knew about Flynn ' s
258,44, discussions of sanctions before the Department of Justice notified the White Hous e of those
258,45, discussions in late January 2017. The evidence also does not establish that Flynn otherwise

259,3,possessed information damaging to the President that would give the President a personal incentive
259,4,to end the FBI ' s inquiry into Flynn ' s conduct.
259,5,          Evidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the FBI's
259,6,"broader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told Christie, that terminating Flynn would"
259,7,"end ""the whole Russia thing."" Flynn's firing occurred at a time when the media and Congress"
259,8,were raising questions about Russia's interference in the election and whether members of the
259,9,President's campaign had colluded with Russia. Multiple witnesses recalled that the President
259,10,viewed the Russia investigations as a challenge to the legitimacy of his election. The President
259,11,paid careful attention to negative coverage of Flynn and reacted with annoyance and anger when
259,12,the story broke disclosing that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Kislyak . Just hours before
259,13,"meeting one-on-one with Corney, the President told Christie that firing Flynn would put an end to"
259,14,"the Russia inquiries . And after Christie pushed back , telling the President that firing Flynn would"
259,15,"not end the Russia investigation , the President asked Christie to reach out to Corney and convey"
259,16,"that the President liked him and he was part of ""the team."" That afternoon , the President cleared"
259,17,"the room and asked Corney to ""let[] Flynn go ."""
259,18,          We also sought evidence relevant to assessing whether the President ' s direction to Corney
259,19,was motivated by sympathy towards Flynn. In public statements the President repeatedly
259,20,"described Flynn as a good person who had been harmed by the Russia investigation, and the"
259,21,"President directed advisors to reach out to Flynn to tell him the President ""care[d]"""
259,22,"about him and felt bad for him. At the same time, multiple senior adv isors, including Bannon,"
259,23,"Priebus, and Hicks, said that the President had become unhappy with Flynn well before Flynn was"
259,24,forced to resign and that the President was frequently irritated with Flynn. Priebus said he believed
259,25,"the President's initial reluctance to fire Flynn stemmed not from personal regard , but from concern"
259,26,about the negative press that would be generated by firing the National Security Advisor so early
259,27, in the Administration. And Priebus indicated that the President's post-firing expressions of
259,28,support for Flynn were motivated by the President's desire to keep Flynn from saying negative
259,29,things about him.
259,30,          The way in which the President communicated the request to Corney also is relevant to
259,31,understanding the President's intent. When the President first learned about the FBI investigation
259,32," into Flynn, he told McGahn , Bannon, and Priebus not to discuss the matter with anyone else in the"
259,33,"White House. The next day, the President invited Corney for a one-on-one dinner against the"
259,34,"advice of an aide who recommended that other White Hous e officials also attend. At the dinner,"
259,35,"the President asked Corney for "" loyalty"" and, at a different point in the conversation , mentioned"
259,36,that Flynn had judgment issues. When the President met with Corney the day after Flynn's
259,37,termination - shortly after being told by Christie that firing Flynn would not end the Russia
259,38," investigation-the    President cleared the room, even excluding the Attorney General , so that he"
259,39, could again speak to Corney alone. The President's decision to meet one-on-one with Corney
259,40, contravened the advice of the White House Counsel that the President should not communicate
259,41, directly with the Department of Justice to avoid any appearance of interfering in law enforcement
259,42," activities. And the President later denied that he clear ed the room and asked Corney to "" let[] Flynn"
259,43," go""- a denial that would have been unnecessary if he believed his request was a proper exercise"
259,44, of prosecutorial discretion.

260,3,"         Finally, the President's effort to have McFarland write an internal email denying that the"
260,4,President had directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak highlights the President ' s concern
260,5,about being associated with Flynn's conduct. The evidence does not establish that the President
260,6,"was trying to have McFarland lie. The President's request, however, was sufficiently irregular"
260,7,that McFarland-who          did not know the full extent of Flynn ' s communications with the President
260,8,and thus could not make the representation the President wanted-felt the need to draft an internal
260,9,"memorandum documenting the President's request, and Eisenberg was concerned that the request"
260,10,would look like a quid pro quo in exchange for an ambassadorship.

261,6,  him not to recuse himse lf from the Russia investigation. 278 McGahn understood the President to
261,7,  be concerned that a recusal would make Sessions look guilty for omitting details in his
261,8,  confirmation hearing; leave the President unprotected from an investigation that could hobble the
261,9,  presidency and derail his policy objectives; and detract from favorable press coverage of a

261,14,"  back to the President about the call with Sessions, and the President reiterated that he did not want"
261,15,"  Sessions to recuse. 282 Throughout the day, McGahn continued trying on behalf of the President to"
261,16,"  avert Sessions's recusal by speaking to Sessions's personal counsel, Sessions's chief of staff, and"
261,17,"  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and by contacting Sessions himself two more times. 283"

265,13,"classified - but he observed that he had ""taken the extraordinary step in consultation with the"

267,16,Intelligence (ODNJ) has nothing to do with investigations and it was not his role to make a public
267,17,statement on the Russia investigation. 336 Pompeo had no recollection of being asked to stay behind

267,24,"and asked him to contact Corney to see if there was a way to get past the investigation , get it over"

272,8,          In analyzing the President's reaction to Sessions 's recusal and the requests he mad e to
272,9,"Coats, Pompeo , Rogers , and Corney , the following evidence is relevant to the elements of"
272,10,obstruction of justice:
272,11,"          a.       Obstructive act. The evidence shows that, after Corney's March 20, 2017"
272,12,"testimony , the President repeatedly reach ed out to intelligence agency leaders to discuss the FBT's"
272,13,investigation. But witnesses had different recollections of the precise content of those outreaches.
272,14,Some ODNI officials recalled that Coats told them immediately after the March 22 Oval Office
272,15,"meeting that the President asked Coats to intervene with Corney and ""stop "" the investigation. But"
272,16,the first-hand witnesses to the encounter remember the conversation differently. Pompeo had no
272,17,"memory of the specific meeting , but generally recalled the President urging officials to get the"
272,18,word out that the President had not done anything wrong relat ed to Russia. Coats recalled that the
272,19,"President asked that Coats state publicly that no link existed between the President and Russia , but"
272,20,did not ask him to speak with Corne y or to help end the investigation. The other outreaches by the
272,21,President during this period were similar in nature: The President asked Rogers if he could do
272,22,"anything to refute the stories linking the President to Russia, and the President asked Corney to"
272,23,"make a public statement that would "" lift the cloud "" of the ongoing inve stigation by making clear"
272,24,"that the President was not personally under investigation. These requests , while significant enough"
272,25,"that Rogers thought it important to document the encounter in a w ritten memorandum , were not"
272,26,interpreted by the officials who received them as directives to improperly interfere with the
272,27, investigation.
272,28,          b.       Nexus to a proceeding. At the time of the President ' s outreaches to leaders of the
272,29," intelligence agencies in late March and early April 2017, the FBI' s Russia investigation did not"
272,30,"yet involve grand jury proceedings. The outr eache s, however , came after and were in res ponse to"
272,31,"Corney's March 20, 2017 announcement that the FBI , as a part of its counterintelligence mission ,"
272,32,was conducting an investigation into Russian interfer ence in the 2016 pre sidential election.
272,33,Corney testified that the inve stigation included any links or coordination with Trump campaign
272,34," officials and would ""include an assessment of whether any crimes wer e committed."""
272,35,"          c.       Intent. As described above , the evidence does not establish that the President asked"
272,36, or directed intelligence agency leaders to stop or interfere with the FBI ' s Russia investigation-
272,37," and the President affi rmatively told Corney that if "" some satellite"" was involved in Russian"
272,38," election interferen ce ""it would be good to find that out. "" But the Presid ent 's intent in trying to"

273,3,"Corney's public announcement of the FBT's Russia investigation , is nevertheless relevant to"
273,4,understanding what motivated the President ' s other actions towards the investigation.
273,5,         The evidence shows that the President was focused on the Russia investigation's
273,6,"implications for his presidency - and , specifically, on dispelling any suggestion that he was under"
273,7,"investigation or had links to Russia. In early March , the President attempted to prevent Sessions's"
273,8,"recusal, even after being told that Sessions was following DOJ conflict-of-interest rules. After"
273,9,"Sessions recused, the White House Counsel's Office tried to cut off further contact with Sessions"
273,10,"about the matter, although it is not clear whether that direction was conveyed to the President. The"
273,11,"President continued to raise the issue of Sessions's recusal and, when he had the opportunity, he"
273,12,pulled Sessions aside and urged him to unrecuse . The President also told advisors that he wanted
273,13,"an Attorney General who would protect him, the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric"
273,14,Holder to have protected their presidents. The Pr.esident made statements about being able to direct

273,17,         After Corney publicly confirmed the existence of the FBT's Russia investigation on March
273,18,"20, 2017, the President was ""beside himself ' and expressed anger that Corney did not issue a"
273,19,statement correcting any misperception that the President himself was under investigation. The
273,20,President sought to speak with Acting Attorney General Boente directly and told McGahn to
273,21,contact Boente to request that Corney make a clarifying statement. The President then asked other
273,22,intelligence community leaders to make public statements to refute the suggestion that the
273,23,"President had links to Russia , but the leaders told him they could not publicly comment on the"
273,24,"investigation . On March 30 and April I I, against the advice of White House advisors who had"
273,25,informed him that any direct contact with the FBI could be perceived as improper interference in
273,26,"an ongoing investigation, the President made personal outreaches to Corney asking him to ""lift the"
273,27,"cloud"" of the Russia investigation by making public the fact that the President was not personally"
273,28,under investigation.
273,29,         Evidence indicates that the President was angered by both the existence of the Russia
273,30,"investigation and the public reporting that he was under investigation, which he knew was not true"
273,31,based on Corney's represe ntations. The President complained to advisors that if people thought
273,32,"Russia helped him with the election, it would detract from what he had accomplished."
273,33,         Other evidence indicate s that the President was concerned about the impact of the Russia
273,34,investigation on his ability to govern . The President complained that the perception that he was
273,35,"under investigation was hurting his ability to conduct foreign relations , particularly with Russia."
273,36,"The President told Coats he ""can't do anything with Russia ,"" he told Rogers that ""the thing with"

274,12,"not under investigation. Two days later , on May 5, 2017, the President told close aides he was"

274,14,that Corney had on three occasions informed the President that he was not under investigation.
274,15,The President decided to fire Corney before receiving advice or a recommendation from the

274,17,it to a recommendation from the Department of Justice based on Corney 's handling of the Clinton
274,18,email investigation. After Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein resisted attributing the firing
274,19,"to his recommendation, the President acknowledged that he intended to fire Corney regardless of"
274,20,the DOJ recommendation and was thinking of the Russia investigation when he made the decision.

286,3,"after being sworn in .495 Late in the morning of May 12, 2017, the President tweeted, "" Again, the"
286,4,story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems
286,5,"as an excuse for losing the election. "" 496 The President also tweeted , ""James Corney better hope"

286,10,"         In analyzing the President's decision to fire Corney, the following evidence is relevant to"
286,11,the elements of obstruction of justice:
286,12,         a.       Obstructive act. The act of firing Corney removed the individual overseeing the
286,13,FBI's Russia investigation. The President knew that Corney was personally involved in the
286,14,"investigation based on Corney's briefing of the Gang of Eight , Corney's March 20, 2017 public"
286,15,"testimony about the investigation, and the President's one -on-one conversations with Corney."
286,16,         Firing Corney would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable effect
286,17,"of interfering with or impeding the investigation-for      example, if the termination would have the"
286,18,effect of delaying or disrupting the investigation or providing the President with the opportunity
286,19,to appoint a director who would take a different approach to the investigation that the President
286,20,perceived as more protective of his personal interests. Relevant circumstances bearing on that
286,21, issue include whether the President's actions had the potential to discourage a successor director
286,22,or other law enforcement officials in their conduct of the Russia investigation . The President fired
286,23,"Corney abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign, banned him from the FBI building,"
286,24,"and criticized him publicly, calling him a "" showboat"" and claiming that the FBI was "" in turmoil"""
286,25,under his leadership. And the President followed the termination with public statements that were
286,26," highly critical of the investigation; for example, three days after firing Corney , the President"
286,27," referred to the investigation as a ""witch hunt "" and asked, ""when does it end? "" Those actions had"
286,28,the potential to affect a successor director ' s conduct of the investigation.
286,29,"          The anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however , would not necessarily be to"
286,30," prevent or impede the FBI from continuing its investigation.               As a general matter, FBI"
286,31, investigations run under the operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the FBI director.
286,32," Bannon made a similar point when he told the President that he could fire the FBI director , but"
286,33, could not fire the FBI. The White House issued a press statement the day after Corney was fired
286,34," that said, ""The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of"
286,35," Corney would not have ended it."" Tn addition, in his May 11 interview with Lester Holt, the"
286,36, President stated that he understood when he made the decision to fire Corney that the action might
286,37," prolong the investigation. And the President chose McCabe to serve as interim dir ector , even"

287,6,that a grand jury proceeding or criminal prosecution arising from an FBI investigation was
287,7,objectively foreseeable and actually contemplated by the President when he terminat ed Corne y.
287,8,"         Several facts would be relevant to such a showing. At .the time the President fired Corney,"
287,9,a grand jury had not begun to hear evidence related to the Russia investigation and no grand jury
287,10,"subpoenas had been issued . On March 20, 2017, however , Corney had announced that the FBI"
287,11,"was investigating Russia's interference in the election , including ""an assessm ent of whether any"
287,12,"crimes were committed ."" It was widely known that the FBI , as part of the Russia investigation ,"
287,13,was investigating the hacking of the DNC's computers-a clear criminal offense.
287,14,"         In addition , at the time the President fired Corney, evidence indicates the President knew"
287,15,"that Flynn was still under criminal investigation and could potentially be prosecuted, despite the"
287,16,"President's February 14, 2017 request that Corney ""let[] Flynn go."" On March 5, 2017, the White"
287,17,House Counsel's Office was informed that the FBI was asking for transition-period records
287,18,"relating to Flynn - indicating that the FBI was still actively investigating him . The same day, the"
287,19,"President told advisors he wanted to call Dana Boente, then the Acting Attorney Gen era l for the"
287,20,"Russia investigation, to find out whether the White House or the President was being investigated."
287,21,"On March 31, 2017, the President signaled his awareness that Flynn remained in legal jeopardy by"
287,22,"tweeting that ""Mike Flynn should ask for immunity"" before he agreed to provide testimony to the"
287,23,"FBI or Congress. And in late March or early April, the President asked McFarland to pass a"
287,24,"message to Flynn telling him that the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong ,"
287,25,further demonstrating the President's awareness of Flynn's criminal exposure.
287,26,         c.      Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst for the President ' s decision
287,27,to fire Corney was Corney 's unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not personally
287,28,"under investigation , despite the President's repeated requests that Corney make such an"
287,29,"announcement. In the week leading up to Corney's May 3, 2017 Senate Judiciary Committee"
287,30,"testimony , the President told McGahn that it would be the last straw if Corney did not set the record"
287,31,straight and publicly announce that the President was not under investigation. But during his May
287,32,"3 testimony , Corney refused to answer questions about whether the President was being"
287,33," investigated. Corney's refusal angered the Presid ent, who criticized Sessions for leaving him"
287,34," isolated and exposed, saying ""You left me on an island."" Two days later, the President told"
287,35,advisors he had decided to fire Corney and dictated a letter to Stephen Miller that began with a
287,36,"reference to the fact that the President was not being investigated: ""While I greatly appreciate you"
287,37, informing me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated
287,38,"story on a Trump-Russia relationship .... "" The President later asked Rosenstein to include"
287,39,"""Russia"" in his memorandum and to say that Corney had told the President that he was not under"
287,40," investigation . And the Pre sident 's final termination letter included a sentence , at the President's"
287,41," insistence and against McGahn ' s advice, stating that Corney had told the President on three"
287,42, separate occasion s that he was not under investigation.
287,43,         The President's other stated rationales for why he fired Corney are not similarly supported
287,44, by the evid ence. The termination letter the President and Stephen Miller prepared in Bedminster

288,3,"cited Corney ' s handling of the Clinton email investigation , and the President told McCabe he fired"
288,4,Corney for that reason. But the facts surrounding Corney's handling of the Clinton email
288,5,"investigation were well known to the President at the time he assumed office , and the President"
288,6,had made it clear to both Corney and the President ' s senior staff in early 2017 that he wanted
288,7,Corney to stay on as director. And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Corney's handling of the
288,8,Clinton investigation after the President had already decided to fire Corney. The President's draft
288,9,termination letter also stated that morale in the FBI was at an all-time low and Sanders told the
288,10,"press after Corney's termination that the White House had heard from ""countless"" FBI agents who"
288,11,had lost confidence in Corney. But the evidence does not support those claims. The President told
288,12,"Corney at their January 27 dinner that ""the people of the FBI really like [him],"" no evidence"
288,13,"suggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Corney, and Sanders"
288,14,acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything.
288,15,         We also considered why it was important to the President that Corney announce publicly
288,16,that he was not under investigatio n. Some evidence indicates that the President believed that the
288,17,erroneous perception he was under investigation harmed his ability to manage domestic and
288,18,"foreign affairs , particularly in dealings with Russia. The President told Corney that the ""cloud"" of"
288,19,"""this Russia business "" was making it difficult to run the country. The President told Sessions and"
288,20,McGahn that foreign leaders had expressed sympathy to him for being under investigation and that
288,21,the perception he was under investigation was hurting his ability to address foreign relations issues .
288,22,"The President complained to Roger s that ""the thing with the Russians [was] messing up"" his ability"
288,23,"to get things done with Russia , and told Coats, ""I can't do anything with Russia , there's things I'd"
288,24,"like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS , they ' re all over me with this."" The President also"
288,25,may have viewed Corney as insubordinate for his failure to make clear in the May 3 testimony that
288,26,the President was not under investigation.
288,27,"         Other evidence, however , indicates that the President wanted to protect himself from an"
288,28,"investigation into his campaign . The day after learning about the FBI's interview of Flynn , the"
288,29,"President had a one-on-one dinner with Corney, against the advice of senior aides, and told Corney"
288,30,"he needed Corney's ""loyalty."" When the President later asked Corney for a second time to make"
288,31,"public that he was not under investigation, he brought up loyalty again, saying ""Be cause I have"
288,32,"been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know."" After the President learned of"
288,33," Sessions's recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious and said he wanted an"
288,34,Attorney General who would protect him the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder
288,35,to have protected their presidents. The President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney
288,36,"General ""who to investigate. """
288,37,"         In addition , the President had a motive to put the FBI's Russia investigation behind him."
288,38,The evidence does not establish that the termination of Corney was designed to cover up a
288,39," conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia: As described in Volume I, the evidence"
288,40,uncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close to him were
288,41," involved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure conspiracies, or that the"
288,42,President otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any Russian official. But the evidence does
288,43, indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the
288,44, President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise
288,45,to personal and political concerns. Although the President publicly stated during and after the
288,46," election that he had no connection to Russia, the Trump Organization, through Michael Cohen ,"

289,11,"           Finally, the President and White House aides initially advanced a pretextual reason to the"
289,12,"  press and the public for Corney's termination. In the immediate aftermath of the firing, the"
289,13,  President dictated a press statement suggesting that he had acted based on the DOJ
289,14,"  recommendations, and White House press officials repeated that story. But the President had"
289,15,  decided to fire Corney before the White House solicited those recommendations.                 Although the
289,16,  President ultimately acknowledged that he was going to fire Corney regardless of the Department
289,17,"  of Justice 's recommendations, he did so only after DOJ officials made clear to him that they would"
289,18,  resist the White House ' s suggestion that they had prompted the process that led to Corney's
289,19,  termination. The initial reliance on a pretextual justification could support an inference that the
289,20,"  President had concerns about providing the real reason for the firing , although the evidence does"
289,21,"  not resolve whether those concerns were personal , political, or both."

289,24,"            The Acting Attorney General appointed a Special Counsel on May 17, 2017 , prompting"
289,25,  the President to state that it was the end of his presidency and that Attorney General Sessions had
289,26,"  failed to protect him and should resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, which the Presid ent"
289,27,  ultimately did not accept. The President told senior advisors that the Special Counsel had conflicts
289,28,"  of interest, but they responded that those claims were ""ridiculous"" and posed no obstacle to the"
289,29,  Special Counsel ' s service. Department of Justice ethics officials similarly cleared the Special
289,30,"  Counsel's service. On June 14, 2017 , the press reported that the President was being personally"
289,31,   investigated for obstruction of ju stice and the President responded with a series of tweets

289,36,            500  In addition to whether the President had a motive related to Russia-related matters that an FBI
289,37,"   investigation could uncover, we considered whether the President's intent in firing Corney was connected"
289,38,  to other conduct that could come to light as a result of the FBT's Russian-interference investigation. In
289,39,"  paiticular, Michael Cohen was a potential subject of investigation because of his pursuit of the Trump"
289,40,  Tower Moscow project and involvement in other activities. And facts uncovered in the Russia
289,41,"   investigation, which our Office referred to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New"
289,42,"  York, ultimately led to the conviction of Cohen in the Southern District ofNew York for campaign-finance"
289,43,"   offenses related to payments he said he made at the direction of the President. See Volume II, Section"
289,44,"   II.K.5, infra. The investigation, however, did not establish that when the President fired Corney, he was"
289,45,   considering the possibility that the FBI's investigation would uncover these payments or that the President's
289,46,   intent in firing Corney was otherwise connected to a concern about these matters coming to light.

299,5,"         That evening, McGahn called both Priebus and Bannon and told them that he intended to"
299,6,"resign. 594   McGahn recalled that, after speaking with his attorney and given the nature of the"
299,7,"President ' s request, he decided not to share details of the President's request with other White"
299,8,"House staff. 595 Priebus recalled that McGahn said that the President had asked him to ""do crazy"

299,10,McGahn was trying to protect Priebus from what he did not need to know. 596 Priebus and Bannon
299,11,"both urged McGahn not to quit, and McGahn ultimately returned to work that Monday and"

299,18,Christie advised against doing so because there was no substantive basis for the Presiden t to fire

300,3,investigation and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry. Even if the removal
300,4,"of the lead prosecutor would not prevent the investigation from continuing under a new app ointee,"
300,5,a factfinder would need to consider whether the act had the potential to delay further action in the
300,6,"investigation, chill the actions of any replacement Special Counsel, or otherwise impede the"
300,7,investigation.
300,8,         A threshold question is whetherthe President in fact directed McGahn to have the Special
300,9,Counsel removed. After news organizations reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered
300,10,"McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly disputed these accounts , and"
300,11,privately told McGahn that he had simply wanted McGahn to bring conflicts of interest to the
300,12,"Department of Justice 's attention . See Volume II, Section II.I , infra. Some of the President's"
300,13,specific language that McGahn recalled from the calls is consistent with that explanation.
300,14,"Substantial evidence , however , supports the conclusion that the President went further and in fact"
300,15,directed McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel removed.
300,16,"         First, McGahn's clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell Rosenstein"
300,17,"not only that conflicts existed but also that ""Mueller has to go ."" McGahn is a credible witness"
300,18,with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House. 601 McGahn
300,19,"spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times , making it"
300,20,"unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the Presid ent 's request. In response to that request,"
300,21,McGahn decided to quit because he did not want to participate in events that he described as akin
300,22,"to the Saturday Night Massacre . He called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packed up his"
300,23,"office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his chief of staff, told Priebus that the President"
300,24,"had asked him to "" do crazy shit,"" and informed Priebus and Bannon that he was leaving. Those"
300,25,acts would be a highly unusual reaction to a request to convey information to the Department of
300,26,Justice.
300,27,"         Second, in the days before the calls to McGahn , the President, through his counsel , had"
300,28,"already brought the asserted conflicts to the attention of the Department of Justice. Accordingly ,"
300,29,the President had no reason to have McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to raise conflicts issues
300,30,that already had been raised.
300,31,"         Third , the President's sense ofurgency and repeated requests to McGahn to take immediate"
300,32,"action on a weekend- "" You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.""-supp0ti McGahn's recollection"
300,33,that the President wanted the Department of Justice to take action to remove the Special Counsel.
300,34,Had the President instead sought only to have the Department of Justice re-examine asserted
300,35,"conflicts to evaluate whether they posed an ethical bar, it would have been unnecess ary to set the"
300,36,process in motion on a Saturday and to make repeated calls to McGahn.
300,37,"         Finally, the President had discussed ""knocking out Mueller "" and raised conflicts of interest"
300,38," in a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn , reflecting that the President connected the conflicts to a plan"
300,39,"to remove the Special Counsel. And in the days leading up to June 17, 2017, the President made"
300,40,"clear to Priebus and Bannon, who then told Ruddy, that the President was considering terminating"
300,41,"         60 1 When this Office first interviewed McGahn about this topic, he was reluctant to share detailed"
300,42, information about what had occurred and only did so after continued questioning. See McGahn 12/14/17

301,3,"the Special Counsel. Also during this time period, the President reached out to Christie to get his"
301,4,thoughts on firing the Special Counsel. This evidence shows that the President was not just seeking
301,5,an examination of whether conflicts existed but instead was looking to use asserted conflicts as a
301,6,way to terminate the Special Counsel.
301,7,"         b.       Nexus to an official proceeding. To satisfy the proceeding requirement, it would"
301,8,be necessary to establish a nexus between the President's act of seeking to terminate the Special
301,9,Counsel and a pending or foreseeable grand jury proceeding .
301,10,"         Substantial evidence indicates that by June 17, 2017, the President knew his conduct was"
301,11,under investigation by a federal prosecutor who could present any evidence of federal crimes to a
301,12,"grand jury. On May 23, 2017, McGahn explicitly warned the President that his ""biggest exposure """
301,13,"was not his act of firing Corney but his ""other contacts"" and ""calls,"" and his ""ask re: Flynn."" By"
301,14,"early June, it was widely reported in t}:iemedia that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury"
301,15,subpoenas in the Flynn inquiry and that the Special Counsel had taken over the Flynn
301,16,"investigation. 602 On June 9, 2017, the Special Counsel's Office informed the White House that"
301,17,investigators would be interviewing intelligence agency officials who allegedl y had been asked by
301,18,"the President to push back against the Russia investigation. On June 14, 2017 , news outlets began"
301,19,reporting that the President was himself being investigated for obstruction of justice. Based on
301,20,"widespread reporting, the President knew that such an investigation could include his request for"
301,21,"Corney's loyalty; his request that Corney ""let[] Flynn go""; his outreach to Coats and Rogers; and"
301,22,his termination of Corney and statement to the Russian Foreign Minister that the termination had
301,23,"relieved ""great pressure"" related to Russia. And on June 16, 2017, the day before he directed"
301,24,"McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly acknowledged that his"
301,25,"conduct was under investigation by a federal prosecutor, tweeting , ""I am being investigated for"
301,26,"firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! """
301,27,         c.       Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that the President's attempts to remove the
301,28,Special Counsel were linked to the Special Counsel's oversight of investigations that involved the
301,29,"President's conduct - and, most immediately , to reports that the President was being investigated"
301,30,for potential obstruction of justice.
301,31,"         Before the President terminated Corney , the President considered it critically important that"
301,32,he was not under investigation and that the public not erroneously think he was being investigated.
301,33,"As described in Volume TI, Section TI.D, supra, advisors perceived the President , while he was"
301,34,"drafting the Corney termination letter, to be concerned more than anything else about getting out"
301,35,that he was not personally under investigation. When the President learned of the appointment of
301,36,"the Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, he expressed further concern about the investigation, saying"
301,37,"""[t]his is the end of my Presidency. "" The President also faulted Sessions for recusing , saying ""you"
301,38,"were supposed to protect me. """
301,39,"         On June 14, 20 I 7, when the Washington Post reported that the Special Counsel was"

302,3,to avoid: a criminal investigation into his own conduct that was the subject of widespread media
302,4,attention. The evidence indicates that news of the obstruction investigation prompted the President
302,5,"to call McGahn and seek to have the Special Counsel removed. By mid-June, the Department of"
302,6,Justice had already cleared the Special Counse l's service and the President's advisors had told him
302,7,"that the claimed conflicts of interest were ""s illy"" and did not provide a basis to remove the Special"
302,8,"Counsel. On June 13, 2017, the Acting Attorney General testified before Congress that no good"
302,9,"cause for removing the Special Counsel existed, and the Pres ident dictated a press statement to"
302,10,"Sanders saying he had no intention of firing the Special Counsel. But the next day, the media"
302,11,reported that the President was under investigation for obstruction of justice and the Specia l
302,12,Counsel was interviewing witnesses about events related to possible obstruction - spurring the
302,13,President to write critical tweets about the Specia l Counsel's investigation. The President called
302,14,McGahn at home that night and then called him on Saturday from Camp David . The evidence
302,15,accordingly indicat es that news that an obstruction investigation had been opened is what led the
302,16,President to call McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated.
302,17,         There also is evidence that the President knew that he should not have made thos e calls to
302,18,McGahn. The President made the calls to McGahn after McGahn had specifically told the
302,19,President that the White House Counsel's Office-and McGahn himself-could not be involved
302,20,in pressing conflicts claims and that the President shoul d consult with his personal counsel if he
302,21,"wished to raise conflicts. Instead of relying on his personal counsel to submit the conflicts claims ,"
302,22,the President sought to use his official powers to remove the Special Counsel. And after the media
302,23,"reported on the President's actions, he denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special"
302,24,"Counsel terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story, as discussed in"
302,25,"Volume II, Section II.I, infra. Those denials are contrary to the evidence and suggest the"

303,13,as possible to make sure he captured the content correctly. 608
303,14,         The President directed that Sessions should give a speech publicly announcing:

304,3,"The President said that if Sessions delivered that statement he would be the ""most popular guy in"
304,4,"the country."" 6 11 Lewandowski told the President he understood what the President wanted Sessions"
304,5,to do. 6 12
304,6,          Lewandowski wanted to pass the message to Sessions in person rather than over the
304,7,         613
304,8,phone.         He did not want to meet at the Department of Justice because he did not want a public
304,9,log of his visit and did not want Sessions to have an advantage over him by meeting on what
304,10,Lewandowski described as Sessions's turf. 614 Lewandowski called Sessions and arranged a
304,11,"meeting for the following evening at Lewandowski's office , but Sessions had to cancel due to a"
304,12,"last minute conflict. 6 15 Shortly thereafter, Lewandowski left Washington, D .C., without having"
304,13,had an opportunity to meet with Sessions to convey the President's message .6 16 Lewandowski
304,14,"stored the notes in a safe at his home , which he stated was his standard procedure with sensitive"
304,15,items. 617
304,16,                   2. The President Follows Up with Lewandowski
304,17,"          Following his June meeting with the President, Lewandowski contacted Rick Dearborn,"
304,18,                                                                                                  618
304,19,"then a senior White House official, and asked if Dearborn could pass a message to Sessions."
304,20,"Dearborn agreed without knowing what the message was, and Lewandowski later confirmed that"
304,21,                                                                                                  619
304,22,Dearborn would meet with Sessions for dinner in late July and could deliver the message then.
304,23,Lewandowski recalled thinking that the President had asked him to pass the message because the
304,24,"President knew Lewandowski could be trusted , but Lewandowski believed Dearborn would be a"
304,25,better messenger because he had a longstanding relationship with Sessions and because Dearborn
304,26,was in the government while Lewandowski was not. 620

309,4,         In analyzing the President's efforts to have Lewandowski deliver a message directing
309,5,Sessions to publicly announce that the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to future
309,6,"election interference , the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:"
309,7,         a.      Obstructive act. The President 's effort to send Sessions a message through
309,8,Lewandowski would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the investigation
309,9,and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.
309,10,"         The President sought to have Sessions announce that the President ""s houldn't have a"
309,11,"Speci al Prosecutor/Counsel "" and that Sessions was going to ""meet with the Special Prosecutor to"
309,12,explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election
309,13,"meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future elections ."" The President wanted"
309,14,"Sessions to disregard his recusal from the investigation, which had followed from a formal DOJ"
309,15,"ethics review , and have Sessions declare that he knew ""for a fact "" that ""there were no Russians"
309,16,"involved with the campaign"" because he ""was there. "" The President further directed that Sessions"
309,17,"should explain that the President should not be subject to an investigation "" because he hasn 't done"
309,18,"anything wrong. "" Taken together , the President 's directives indicate that Sessions was being"
309,19,instructed to tell the Special Counsel to end the existing investigation into the President and his
309,20,"campaign, with the Special Counsel being permitted to ""move forward with investigating election"
309,21,"meddling for future elections."""
309,22,"           b.    Nexus to an official proceeding. As described above, by the time of the President's"
309,23,"initial one-on-one meeting with Lewandowski on June 19, 2017, the existence of a grand jury"
309,24,investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was ublic knowled e. B the time of the
309,25,"President's follow -u meetin with Lewandowski,"
309,26,"                              See Volume II, Section 11.G, infra. To satisfy the nexus requirement ,"
309,27,it would be nece ssary to show that limiting the Special Counsel's investigation would have the
309,28,natural and probable effect of impeding that grand jury proceeding .
309,29,          c.     Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that the President 's effort to have Sessions
309,30,limit the scope of the Special Counsel's investigation to future election interference was intended
309,31,to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President ' s and his campaign's conduct.
309,32,"          As previously described , see Volume TT, Section II.B, supra, the Presiden t knew that the"
309,33,"Russia investigation was focused in part on his campaign , and he perceived allegations of Rus sian"
309,34, interference to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his election . The Pres ident further knew that the
309,35, investigation had broadened to include his own conduct and whether he had obstructed justice.
309,36,Those investigations would not proceed if the Special Counsel's jurisdiction were limited to future
309,37,election interferen ce only.
309,38,          The timing and circumstance s of the President's actions support the conclusion that he
309,39,sought that result. The President's initial direction that Sessions should limit the Special Counsel's
309,40, investigation came just two days after the President had ordered McGahn to ~ave the Special
309,41,"Counsel removed, which itself followed public reports that the President wa s person a lly under"

310,4,investigation for obstruction of justice. The sequence of those events raises an inference that after
310,5,"seeking to terminate the Special Counsel, the President sought to exclude his and his campaign's"
310,6,conduct from the investigation ' s scope. The President raised the matter with Lewandowski again
310,7,"on July 19, 2017, just days after emails and information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between"
310,8,"Russians and senior campaign officials had been publicly disclosed , generating substantial media"
310,9,coverage and investigative interest.
310,10,         The manner in which the President acted provides additional evidence of his intent. Rather
310,11,"than rely on official channels , the President met with Lewandowski alone in the Oval Office . The"
310,12,"President selected a loyal ""devotee "" outside the White House to deliver the message, supporting"
310,13,"an inference that he was working outside White House channels , including McGahn, who had"
310,14,previously resisted contacting the Department of Justice about the Special Counsel. The President
310,15,"also did not contact the Acting Attorney General, who had just testified publicly that there was no"
310,16,"cause to remove the Special Counsel. Instead, the President tried to use Sessions to restrict and"
310,17,redirect the Special Counsel's investigation when Sessions was recused and could not properly
310,18,take any action on it.
310,19,"         The July 19, 2017 events provide further evidence of the President's intent. The President"
310,20,followed up with Lewandowski in a separate one-on-one meeting one month after he first dictated
310,21,"the message for Sessions, demonstrating he still sought to pursue the request. And just hours after"
310,22,"Lewandowski assured the President that the message would soon be delivered to Sessions, the"
310,23,President gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he publicly attacked
310,24,"Sessions and raised questions about his job security. Four days later, on July 22, 2017, the"
310,25,President directed Priebus to obtain Sessions's resignation. That evidence could raise an infer ence
310,26,that the President wanted Sessions to realize that his job might be on the line as he evaluated
310,27,"whether to comply with the President 's direction that Sessions publicly announce that,"
310,28,"notwithstanding his recusal , he was going to confine the Special Counsel's investigation to future"
310,29,election interference.

318,3,"9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and a Russian attorney. On June 29, Hicks"
318,4,"warned the President that the emails setting up the June 9 meeting were ""really bad "" and the story"
318,5,"would be ""massive"" when it broke, but the President told her and Kushner to ""leave it alone. """
318,6,"Early on July 8, after Hicks told the President the New York Times was working on a story about"
318,7,"the June 9 meeting, the President directed her not to comment, even though Hicks said that the"
318,8,"President usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin. Later that day, the"
318,9,President rejected Trump Jr. 's draft statement that would have acknowledged that the meeting was
318,10,"with ""a n individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign ."" The"
318,11,President then dictated a statement to Hicks that said the meeting was about Russian adoption
318,12,(which the President had twice been told was discussed at the meeting) . The statement dictated
318,13,by the President did not mention the offer of derogatory information about Clinton.
318,14,         Each of these efforts by the President involved his communications team and was directed
318,15,"at the press. They would amount to obstructive acts only if the President , by taking these actions,"
318,16,sought to withhold information from or mislead congressional investigators or the Special Counsel.
318,17,"On May 17, 2017, the President's campaign receiv ed a document request from SSCI that clearly"
318,18,"covered the June 9 meeting and underlying emails , and those documents also plainly would have"
318,19,been relevant to the Special Counsel ' s investigation .
318,20,         But the evidence does not establish that the President took steps to prevent the emails or
318,21,other information about the June 9 meeting from being provided to Congress or the Special
318,22,Counsel. The series of discussions in which the President sought to limit access to the emails and
318,23,prevent their public release occurred in the context of developing a press strategy . The only
318,24,"evidence ,we have of the President discussing the production of documents to Congress or the"
318,25," Special Counsel is the conversation on June 29, 2017, when Hicks recalled the President"
318,26,acknowledging that Kushner 's attorney should provide emails related to the June 9 meeting to
318,27,whomever he needed to give them to. We do not have evidence of what the President discussed
318,28,with his own lawyers at that time.
318,29,"          b.     Nexus to an official proceeding. As described above, by the time of the President's"
318,30," attempts to prevent the public release of the emails regarding the June 9 meeting, the existence of"
318,31," a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge, and the"
318,32,President had been told that the emails were responsive to congressional inquiries. To satisfy the
318,33," nexus requirement, however, it would be necessary to show that preventing the release of the"
318,34, emails to the public would have the natural and probable effect of impeding the grand jury
318,35," proceeding or congressional inquiries. As noted abov e, the evidence does not establish that the"
318,36,President sought to prevent disclosur e of the emails in those official proceedings.
318,37,         c.      intent. The evidence establishes the President' s substantial involvement in the
318,38, communications strategy related to information about his campaign's connections to Rus sia and
318,39, his desire to minimize public disclosures about those connection s. The President became aware
318,40," of the emails no later than June 29, 2017, when he discussed them with Hicks and Kushner , and"
318,41," he could have been aware of them as early as June 2, 2017, when lawyers for the Trump"
318,42, Organi zation began interviewing witnesses who participated in the June 9 meeting. The President
318,43, thereafter repeatedly rejected the advice of Hicks and other staffers to publicly release information
318,44, about the June 9 meeting. The President expressed concern that multiple people had access to the
318,45, emails and instructed Hicks that only one lawyer should deal with the matter. And the President

319,6,prevent the Special Counsel's Office or Congress from obtaining the emails setting up the June 9
319,7,meeting or other information about that meeting. The statement recorded by Corallo-that               the
319,8,"emails ""will never get out""-can be explained as reflecting a belief that the emails would not be"

319,13,                                                   Overview
319,14,"        From summer 2017 through 2018 , the President attempted to have Attorney General"
319,15,"Sessions reverse his recusal , take control of the Special Counsel's investigation , and order an"
319,16,investigation of Hillary Clinton.

319,19,"         After returning Sessions's resignation letter at the end of May 2017 , but before the"
319,20,"President's July 19, 2017 New York Times interview in which he publicly criticized Sessions for"
319,21,"recusing from the Russia investigation, the President took additional steps to have Sessions reverse"
319,22,"his recusal. In particular, at some point after the May 17, 2017 appointment of the Special Counsel,"
319,23,"Sessions recalled, the President called him at home and asked if Sess ions would ""unrecuse """
319,24,"himself. 736 According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions"
319,25,"could direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the ""gist"""
319,26,"of the conversation was that the President wanted Sessions to unrecus e from ""all of it,"" including"
319,27,"the Special Counsel's Russia investigation. 737 Sessions listened but did not respond, and he did"
319,28,not reverse his recusal or order an investigation of Clinton. 738
319,29,"         In early July 2017, the President asked Staff Secretary Rob Porter what he thought of"
319,30,Associat e Attorney General Rachel Brand .739 Porter recalled that the President asked him if Brand
319,31,"was good, tough, and ""o n the team. "" 740 The President also asked if Porter thought Brand was"
319,32,interested in being responsible for the Special Counsel's investigation and whether she would want

320,6,"Contemporaneous notes taken by Porter show that the President told Porter to ""Keep in touch with"

320,8,"whether he had spoken to Brand, but Porter did not reach out to her because he was uncomfortable"
320,9,"with the task. 744 In asking him to reach out to Brand , Porter understood the President to want to"
320,10,"find someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the Special Counsel, although the President"
320,11,never said so explicitly. 745 Porter did not contact Brand because he was sensitive to the
320,12,implications of that action and did not want to be involved in a chain of events associated with an
320,13,effort to end the investigation or fire the Special Counsel. 746
320,14,"          McGahn recalled that during the summer of 201 7, he and the President discussed the fact"
320,15,that if Sessions were no longer in his position the Special Counsel would report directly to a non-
320,16,recused Attorney General. 747 McGahn told the President that things might not change much under
320,17,"a new Attorney General. 748 McGahn also recalled that in or around July 2017 , the President"
320,18,frequently brought up his displeasure with Sessions. 749 Hicks recalled that the President viewed
320,19,Sessions's recusal from the Russia investigation as an act of disloyalty .750 In addition to criticizing
320,20,"Sessions's recusal , the President raised other concerns about Sessions and his job performance"
320,21,with McGahn and Hicks. 751

320,24,"were no longer in his position, Brand would, by default, become the DOJ official in charge of supervising"

321,4,                      by his Recusal
321,5,"         Later in 2017 , the President continued to urge Sessions to reverse his recusal from"
321,6,campaign-related investigations and considered replacing Sessions with an Attorney General who
321,7,would not be recused.
321,8,"         On October 16, 2017, the President met privately with Sessions and said that the"
321,9,Department of Justice was not investigating individuals and events that the President thought the
321,10,"Department should be investigating. 752 According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, who"
321,11,"was at the meeting, the President mentioned Clinton's emails and said, ""Don 't have to tell us, just"
321,12,"take [a] look."" 753 Sessions did not offer any assurances or promises to the President that the"
321,13,"Department of Justice would comply with that request. 754 Two days later, on October 18, 2017 ,"
321,14,"the President tweeted, ""Wow, FBI confirms report that James Corney drafted letter exonerating"
321,15,"Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many people not interviewed,"
321,16,including Clinton herself. Corney stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where
321,17,"is Justice Dept? "" 755 On October 29, 2017, the President tweeted that there was ""A NGER &"
321,18,"UNITY"" over a ""lack of investigation"" of Clinton arid ""the Corney fix ,"" and concluded : "" DO"
321,19,"SOMETHTNG!"" 756"
321,20,"         On December 6, 2017, five days after Flynn pleaded gui lty to lying about his contacts with"
321,21,"the Russian government, the President asked to speak with Sessions in the Oval Office at the end"
321,22,"of a cabinet meeting. 757 During that Oval Office meeting , which Porter attended , the President"
321,23,"again suggested that Sessions could "" unrecuse,"" which Porter linked to taking back supervision of"
321,24,the Russia investigation and directing an investigation of Hillary Clinton. 758 According to
321,25,"contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, the President said , ""T don't know if you could un-recuse"
321,26,yourself. You'd be a hero. Not telling yo u to do anything. Dershowitz says POTUS can get
321,27,involved. Can order AG to investigate . I don 't want to get involved. I'm not going to get involved.

324,3,other campaign-related matters. The inquiry would not tum on what Attorney General Sessions
324,4,"would actually do if unrecused, but on wheth er the efforts to reverse his recusal would naturally"
324,5,have had the effect of impeding the Russia investigation.
324,6,"        On multiple occasions in 2017, the President spoke with Sessions about reversing his"
324,7,recusal so that he could take over the Russia investigation and begin an investigation and
324,8,"prosecution of Hillary Clinton. For example, in early summer 2017 , Sessions recalled the"
324,9,"President asking him to unrecuse , but Sessions did not take it as a directive. When the President"
324,10,"raised the issue again in December 2017 , the President said, as recorded by Porter , ""Not telling"
324,11,you to do anything ... . I' m not going to get involv ed. I' m not going to do anything or direct you
324,12,"to do anything . I just want to be treated fairly."" The duration of the President's efforts-which"
324,13,spanned from March 2017 to August 2018-and the fact that the President repeatedly criticized
324,14,Sessions in public and in private for failing to tell the President that he would have to recuse is
324,15,relevant to assessing whether the President ' s effotts to have Sessions unrecuse could qualify as
324,16,obstructive acts.
324,17,"        b. Nexus to an official proceeding. As described above , by mid-June 2017, the existence"
324,18,"of a grand jury investigation superv ised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. In addition ,"
324,19,"in July 2017 , a different grand jury supervised by the Special Counsel was empaneled in the"
324,20,"District of Columbia, and the press reported on the existence of this grand jury in early August"
324,21,2017. 776 Whether the conduct towards the Attorney General would have a foreseeable impact on
324,22,those proceedings turns on much of the same evidence discussed above with respect to the
324,23,obstructive-act element.
324,24,        c. Intent. There is evidence that at least one purpose of the President ' s conduct toward
324,25,Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a
324,26,"way that would restrict its scope. By the summer of 2017, the President was aware that the Special"
324,27,Counsel was investigating him personally for obstruction of justice. And in the wake of the
324,28,disclosures of emails about the June 9 meeting between Russians and senior members of the
324,29,"campaign , see Volume IT, Section TI.G, supra, it was evident that the investigation into the"
324,30,"campaign now included the President's son, son-in-law , and former campaign manager. The"
324,31,President had previously and unsuccessfully sought to have Sessions publicly announce that the
324,32,Special Counsel investigation would be confined to future election interference. Yet Sessions
324,33,"remained recused . In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty, the President spoke to"
324,34,Sessions in the Oval Office with only Porter present and told Sessions that he would be a hero if
324,35,he unrecused. Porter linked that request to the President's desir e that Sessions take back
324,36,supervision of the Russia investigation and direct an investigation of Hillary Clinton. The
324,37,"President said in that meeting that he ""just want[ ed] to be treated fairl y,"" which could refle ct his"
324,38,perception that it was unfair that he was being investigated while Hillary Clinton was not. But a
324,39,principal effect of that act would be to restore supervision of the Russia investigation to the
324,40,Attorney General-a position that the President frequently suggested should be occupied by
324,41," someone like Eric Holder and Bobby Kennedy, who the President described as protecting their"

325,10,"         In late January 2018, the media reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered"
325,11,McGahn to have the Special Counsel fired based on purported conflicts of interest but McGahn
325,12,"had refused, saying he would quit instead. After the story broke, the President, through his"
325,13,"personal counsel and two aides , sought to have McGahn deny that he had been directed to remove"
325,14,"the Special Counsel. Each time he was approached , McGahn responded that he would not refute"
325,15,the press accounts because they were accurate in reporting on the President's effort to have the
325,16,Special Counsel removed. The President later personally met with McGahn in the Oval Office
325,17,with only the Chief of Staff present and tried to get McGahn to say that the President never ordered
325,18,him to fire the Special Counsel. McGahn refused and insisted his memory of the President ' s
325,19,"direction to remove the Special Counsel was accurate. In that same meeting , the President"
325,20,challenged McGahn for taking notes of his discussions with the President and asked why he had
325,21,told Special Counsel investigators that he had been directed to have the Special Counsel removed .

326,13,that the President wanted McGahn to put out a statement denying that he had been asked to tire
326,14,the Special Counsel and that he had threatened to quit in protest. 784 McGahn's attorney spoke with
326,15,McGahn about that request and then called the President's personal counsel to relay that McGahn
326,16,would not make a statement. 785 McGahn 's attorney informed the President's personal counsel that
326,17,the Times story was accurate in reporting that the President wanted the Special Counsel
326,18,"removed. 786 Accordingly, McGahn's attorney said, although the article was inaccurate in some"
326,19,                                                                                                           787

330,3,"had not backed down and wou ld not budge. 828 Following the Oval Office meeting, the President's"
330,4,"personal counsel called McGahn' s counsel and relayed that the President was '""fine"" with"

330,6,                                                    Analysis
330,7,         In analyzing the President ' s efforts to have McGahn deny that he had been ordered to have
330,8,"the Special Counsel removed, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of"
330,9,justice:
330,10,         a.        Obstructive act. The President's repeated efforts to get McGahn to create a record
330,11,denying that the President had directed him to remove the Special Counsel would qualify as an
330,12,obstructive act if it had the natural tendency to constrain McGahn from testifying truthfully or to
330,13," undermine his credibility as a potential witness ifhe testified consistently with his memory, rather"
330,14,than with what the record said.
330,15,          There is some evidence that at the time the New York Times and Washington Post stories
330,16,"were published in late January 2018, the President believed the stories were wrong and that he had"
330,17, never told McGahn to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. The President correctly
330,18,"understood that McGahn had not told the President directly that he planned to resign. Tnaddition ,"
330,19," the President told Priebus and Porter that he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel , and"
330,20," in the Oval Office meeting with McGahn , the President said , ""I never said to fire Mueller. I never"
330,21," said 'fire.""' That evidence could indicate that the President was not attempting to persuade"
330,22, McGahn to change his story but was instead offering his own-but different-recollection                of the
330,23, substance of his June 2017 conversations with McGahn and McGahn 's reaction to them.
330,24,          Other evidence cuts against that understanding of the President 's conduct. As previously
330,25," described, see Volume IT, Section ILE, supra, substantial evidence supports McGahn's account"
330,26," that the President had directe d him to have the Special Counsel removed, including the timing and"
330,27, cont ext of the President's directive ; the manner in which McGahn reacted; and the fact that the
330,28," President had been told the conflicts were insubstantial, were being considered by the Department"
330,29," of Justice , and should be raised with the President's personal counsel rather than brought to"
330,30," McGahn. In addition, the President's subsequent denials that he had told McGahn to have the"
330,31, Specia l Counsel removed were carefully worded. When first asked about the New York Times
330,32," story, the President said, ""Fake news, folks. Fake news. A typical New York Times fake story. """
330,33," And when the President spoke with McGahn in the Oval Office, he focused on whether he had"
330,34," used the word ""fire, "" saying, ""I never said to fire Mueller. I never said ' fire""' and ""Did T say the"
330,35," word ' fire'?"" The President's asse rtion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed"
330,36, McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed thus runs counter to the evidence .
330,37,"          Tn addition, even if the President sincerely disagreed with McGahn's memory of the June"

331,3,meeting that McGahn's account differed and that McGahn was firm in his views . Shortly after the
331,4,"story broke, the President's counsel told McGahn 's counsel that the President wanted McGahn to"
331,5,"make a statement denying he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel, but McGahn responded"
331,6,through his counsel that that aspect of the story was accurate and he therefore could not comply
331,7,with the President's request. The President then directed Sanders to tell McGahn to correct the
331,8,"story, but McGahn told her he would not do so because the story was accurate in reporting on the"
331,9,"President's order . Consistent with that position, McGahn never issued a correction. More than a"
331,10,"week later, the President brought up the issue again with Porter, made comments indicating the"
331,11,"President thought McGahn had leaked the story , and directed Porter to have McGahn create a"
331,12,"record denying that the President had tried to fire the Special Counsel. At that point , the President"
331,13,"said he might ""have to get rid of' McGahn ifMcGahn did not comply. McGahn again refused and"
331,14,"told Porter, as he had told Sanders and as his counsel had told the President 's counsel , that the"
331,15,President had in fact ordered him to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. That evidence
331,16,indicates that by the time of the Oval Office meeting the President was aware that McGahn did not
331,17,think the story was false and did not want to issue a statement or create a written record denying
331,18,facts that McGahn believed to be true . The President nevertheless persisted and asked McGahn to
331,19,repudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were accurate.
331,20,"          b.      Nexus to an official proceeding. By January 2018 , the Special Counsel ' s use of a"
331,21,grand jury had been further confirmed by the return of several indictments. The President also
331,22,"was aware that the Special Counsel was investigating obstruction-related events because, among"
331,23,"other reasons, on January 8, 20 I 8, the Special Counsel's Office provided his counsel with a"
331,24,detailed list of topics for a possible interview with the President. 830 The President knew that
331,25,McGahn had personal knowledge of many of the events the Special Counsel was investigating and
331,26,that McGahn had already been interviewed by Special Counsel investigators. And in the Oval
331,27,"Office meeting, the President indicated he knew that McGahn had told the Special Counsel's"
331,28,Office about the President's effort to remove the Special Counsel. The President challenged
331,29,McGahn for disclosing that information and for taking notes that he viewed as creating
331,30,"unnecessary legal exposure. That evidence indicates the President's awareness that the June 17,"
331,31,2017 events were relevant to the Special Counsel's investigation and any grand jury investigation
331,32,that might grow out ofit.
331,33,"          To establish a nexus, it would be necessary to show that the President's actions would have"
331,34,"the natural tendency to affect such a proceeding or that they would hinder, delay , or prevent the"
331,35,communication of information to investigators. Because McGahn had spoken to Special Counsel
331,36," investigators before January 2018, the President could not have been seeking to influence his prior"
331,37, statements in those interviews . But because McGahn had repeate dly spoken to investigators and
331,38,"the obstruction inquiry was not complete , it was foreseeable that he would be interviewed again"
331,39, on obstruction-related topics. If the President were focus ed solely on a press strategy in seeking
331,40," to have McGahn refute the New York Times article, a nexus to a proceeding or to further"
331,41, investigative interviews would not be shown. But the President's efforts to have McGahn write a
331,42," letter ""for our records"" approximately ten days after the stories had come out- well past the typical"

332,5,arising from it.
332,6,         c.      Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute
332,7,"that he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated , the President acted for the purpose of"
332,8,influencing McGahn 's account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President's
332,9,conduct towards the investigation.
332,10,         Several facts support that conclus ion. The President made repeated attempts to get
332,11,"McGahn to change his story. As described above, by the time of the last attempt , the evidence"
332,12,suggests that the President had been told on multiple occasions that McGahn believed the President
332,13,had ordered him to have the Special Counsel terminated. McGahn interpreted his encounter with
332,14,the President in the Oval Office as an attempt to test his mettle and see how committed he was to
332,15,his memory of what had occurred . The President had already laid the groundwork for pressing
332,16,McGahn to alter his account by telling Porter that it might be necessary to fire McGahn if he did
332,17,"not deny the story, and Porter relayed that statement to McGahn. Additiona l evidence of the"
332,18,President 's intent may be gleaned from the fact that his counsel was sufficiently alarmed by the
332,19,prospect of the President's meeting with McGahn that he called McGahn ' s counsel and said that
332,20,McGahn could not resign no matter what happened in the Oval Office that day. The President's
332,21,counsel was well aware ofMcGahn's resolve not to issue what he believed to be a false account
332,22,"of events despite the President's request. Finally , as noted above, the President brought up the"
332,23,Special Counsel investigation in his Oval Office meeting with McGahn and criticized him for
332,24,"telling this Office about the June 17, 2017 events. The President's statements reflect his"
332,25,understanding-and his displeasure-that those events would be part of an obstruction-of-justice

343,5,"         In analyzing the President 's conduct towards Flynn , Manafort,        litlllll , the following"
343,6,evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:
343,7,         a.      Obstructive act. The President's actions towards witnesses in the Special Counsel's
343,8,investigation would qualify as obstructive if they had the natural tendency to prevent particular
343,9,"witnesses from testifying truthfully, or otherwise would have the probable effect of influencing,"
343,10,"delaying, or preventing their testimony to law enforcement."
343,11,"         With regard to Flynn, the President sent private and public messages to Flynn encouraging"
343,12,him to stay strong and conveying that the President still cared about him before he began to
343,13,cooperate with the government. When Flynn's attorneys withdrew him from a joint defense
343,14,"agreement with the President, signaling that Flynn was potentially cooperating with the"
343,15,"government, the President's personal counsel initially reminded Flynn's counsel of the President's"
343,16,"warm feelings towards Flynn and said ""that still remains."" But when Flynn's counsel reiterated"
343,17,"that Flynn could no longer share information under a joint defense agreement , the President's"
343,18,personal counsel stated that the decision would be interpreted as reflecting Flynn's hostility
343,19,towards the President. That sequence of events could have had the potential to affec t Flynn's
343,20,"decision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation. Because of privilege issues,"
343,21,"however, we could not determine whether the President was personally involved in or knew about"
343,22,the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn's counsel.
343,23,"         With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President's actions had the potential to"
343,24,influence Manafort's decision whether to cooperate with the government. The President and his
343,25,"per so nal counsel made repeated statements suggesting that a pardon was a possibility for Mana fort,"
343,26,"while also making it clear that the President did not want Manafort to ""flip"" and cooperate with"
343,27,"the government. On June 15, 2018 , the day the judge presiding over Manafort's D.C. case was"
343,28,"considering whether to revoke his bail, the President said that he ""fe lt badly"" for Manafort and"
343,29,"stated , ""I think a lot of it is very unfair."" And when asked about a pardon for Manafort, the"
343,30,"President sai d, ""I do want to see people treated fairly. That 's what it's all about."" Later that day,"
343,31,"after Manafort's bail was revoked, t.he President called it a "" tough se ntence "" that was ""Very"
343,32,"unfair! "" Two days later , the President ' s personal counsel stated that individual s involved in the"
343,33,"Special Counsel ' s inve stigation could receive a pardon "" if in fact the [P]resident and his advisors"
343,34,".. . come to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly ""- using languag e that paralleled"
343,35,"how the President had already described the treatment ofManafort. Those statements , combined"
343,36,"with the President's commendation ofManafort for being a ""brave man"" who "" refused to ' break ', """
343,37,suggested that a pardon was a more likely possibility if Mana fort continued not to cooperate wit h
343,38,the government.         And while Manafort eventually pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation
343,39,"agreement, he was found to have violated the agreement by lying to inves tigators."
343,40,"         The President ' s public statements during the Manafort tr ial, including during jury"
343,41,"deliberations, also had the potential to influence the trial jury. On the second day of trial, for"
343,42,"exa mple , the President called the prosecution a ""t errible situation "" and a "" hoax"" that ""con tinue s to"
343,43,"stain our country "" and referred to Manafort as a ""Reagan/Dole darling"" who was ""serving solitary"
343,44,"confinement"" even thou gh he was ""conv icted of nothing."" Those statements were widely picked"
343,45,up by the press. While jurors were instructed not to watch or read news stories about the case and
343,46,                                                        131

344,3,"are presumed to follow those instructions, the President's statements during the trial generated"
344,4,substantial media coverage that could have reached jurors if they happened to see the statements
344,5,or learned about them from others. And the President ' s statements during jury deliberations that
344,6,"Manafort ""happens to be a very good person"" and that "" it's very sad what they've done to Paul"

344,9,"         b.      Nexus to an official proceeding. The President's actions towards Flynn, Manafort,"
344,10,--           appear to have been connected to pending or ~d            official proceedings involving
344,11,each individual. The President's conduct towards Flynn~               principally occurred when both
344,12,were under criminal investigation by the Special Counsel's Office and press reports speculated
344,13,about whether they would cooperate with the Special Counsel's investigation. And the President's
344,14,conduct towards Manafort was directly connected to the official proceedings involving him. The
344,15,President made statements about Manafort and the charges against him during Manafort's criminal
344,16,"trial. And the President's comments about the prospect of Manafort "" flipping "" occurred when it"
344,17,was clear the Special Counsel continued to oversee grand jury proceedings .
344,18,         c.      Intent. Evidence concerning the President's intent related to Flynn as a potential
344,19," witness is inconclusive. As previously noted, because of privilege issues we do not have ev idence"
344,20, establishing whether the President knew about or was involved in his counsel ' s communications
344,21, with Flynn's counsel stating that Flynn's decision to withdraw from the joint defense agreement
344,22," and cooperate with the government would be viewed as reflecting ""hostility "" towards the"
344,23," President. And regardless of what the President ' s personal counsel communicated , the President"
344,24, continued to express sympathy for Flynn after he pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation
344,25," agreement, stating that Flynn had ""led a very strong life"" and the President ""fe[lt] very badly """
344,26, about what had happened to him.
344,27,          Evidence concerning the President's conduct towards Manafort indicates that the President
344,28, intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government. Before Manafort was
344,29," convicted, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort had been treated unfairly . One day after"
344,30," Manafort was convicted on eight felony charges and potentially faced a lengthy prison term , the"
344,31," President said that Manafort was ""a brave man "" for refusing to ""b reak"" and that "" flipping"" ""almost"
344,32," ought to be outlawed."" At the same time , although the President had privately told aides he did"
344,33," not like Manafort, he publicly called Mana fort ""a good man"" and said he had a "" wonderful family."""
344,34," And when the President was asked whether he was considering a pardon for Manafort , the"
344,35," President did not respond directly and instead said he had ""g reat respect for what [Manafort]'s"
344,36," done, in terms of what he's gone through."" The President added that ""so me of th e charges they"
344,37," threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does."" In light of the"
344,38," President's counsel's previous statements that the investigations ""m ight get cleaned up with some"
344,39," presidential pardons"" and that a pardon would be possible if the President ""come[s ] to the"
344,40," conclusion that you have been treated unfairl y,"" the evidence supports the inference that the"

345,4,cooperation with the government as a means of obtaining a lesser sentence unnecessary.
345,5,        We also examined the evidence of the President's intent in making public statements about
345,6,Manafort at the beginning of his trial and when the jury was deliberating. Some evidence supports
345,7,"a conclusion that the President intended, at least in part , to influence the jury. The trial generated"
345,8,"widespread publicity, and as the jury began to deliberate, commentators suggested that an acquittal"
345,9,would add to pressure to end the Special Counsel's investigation. By publicly stating on the second
345,10,"day of deliberations that Manafort ""happens to be a very good person"" and that "" it's very sad what"
345,11,"they've done to Paul Manafort"" right after calling the Special Counsel 's investigation a ""rigged"
345,12,"witch hunt,"" the President ' s statements could, if they reached jurors, have the natural tendency to"
345,13,"engender sympathy for Manafort among jurors, and a factfinder could infer that the President"
345,14,"intended that result. But there are alternative explanations for the President's comments, including"
345,15,that he genuinely felt sorry for Manafort or that his goal was not to influence the jury but to
345,16,influence public opinion. The President's comments also could have been intended to continue
345,17,"sending a message to Manafort that a pardon was possible. As described above , the President"
345,18,"made his comments about Manafort being ""a very good person"" immediately after declining to"
345,19,answer a question about whether he would pardon Manafort.

346,5,         The President's conduct involving Michael Cohen spans the full period of our
346,6,"investigation. During the campaign, Cohen pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf"
346,7,"of the Trump Organization. Cohen briefed candidate Trump on the project numerous times,"
346,8,including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to advance the deal. After the media
346,9,"began questioning Trump ' s connections to Russia , Cohen promoted a ""party line "" that publicly"
346,10,distanced Trump from Russia and asserted he had no business there. Cohen continued to adhere
346,11,"to that party line in 2017, when Congress asked him to provide documents and testimony in its"
346,12,"Russia investigation. [n an attempt to minimize the President 's connections to Russia , Cohen"
346,13,submitted a letter to Congress falsely stating that he only briefed Trump on the Trump Tower
346,14,"Moscow project three times , that he did not consider asking Trump to travel to Russia , that Cohen"
346,15,"had not received a response to an outreach he made to the Russian government, and that the project"
346,16,"ended in January 2016, before the first Republican caucus or primary. While working on the"
346,17,"congressional statement , Cohen had extensive discussions with the President ' s personal counsel ,"
346,18,"who, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should not contradict the President and should keep the"
346,19,"statement short and ""tight."" After the FBI searched Cohen 's home and office in April 2018, the"
346,20,"President publicly asserted that Cohen would not ""flip"" and privately passed messages of support"
346,21,to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President's personal counsel and believed that if
346,22,"he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do ""something else"" to make"
346,23,"the investigation end. But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in July 2018 , the"
346,24,"President publicly criticized him, called him a ""rat,"" and suggested his family members had"
346,25,committed crimes.

351,5,discussed the talking points with Trump but that he did not explicitly tell Trump he thought they
351,6,were untrue because Trump already knew they were untrue. 951 Cohen thought it was important to
351,7,"say the deal was done in January 2016 , rather than acknowledge that talks continued in May and"
351,8,"June 2016 , because it limited the period when candidate Trump could be alleged to have a"

351,14,documents in connection with congressional investigations of Russian interference in the 2016

351,17,in Prague during the campaign. 954 Cohen had never traveled to Prague and was not concerned

351,44,"Office advised his counsel not to provide any communications that would be covered by any other privilege,"

352,3,said that in those conversations the President ' s personal counsel would sometimes say that he had
352,4,just been with the President. 959 Cohen recalled that the President ' s personal counsel told him the
352,5,JOA was working well together and assured him that there was nothing there and if they stayed on
352,6,"message the investigations would come to an end soon. 960 At that time, Cohen's legal bills were"
352,7,"being paid by the Trump Organization ,961 and Cohen was told not to worry because the"
352,8, investigations would be over by summer or fall of 20 l 7.962 Cohen said that the President's
352,9,"personal counsel also conveyed that, as part of the JOA, Cohen was protected, which he would not"
352,10,"be if he ""went rogue."" 963 Cohen recalled that the President's personal counsel reminded him that"

352,12,"         In August 2017, Cohen began drafting a statement about Trump Tower Moscow to submit"
352,13,to Congress along with his document production. 965 The final version of the statement contained
352,14,"several false statements about the project. 966 First, although the Trump Organization continued to"
352,15,"pursue the project until at least June 2016, the statement said, ""The proposal was under"
352,16,consideration at the Trump Organization from September 2015 until the end of January 2016. By
352,17,"the end of January 2016 , I determined that the proposal was not feasible for a variety of business"
352,18,"reasons and should not be pursued further. Based on my business determi nations , the Trump"
352,19,"Organization abandoned the proposal."" 967 Second, although Cohen and candidate Trump had"
352,20,"discussed possible travel to Russia by Trump to pursue the venture, the statement said , ""Despite"
352,21,"overtures by Mr. Sater, I never considered asking Mr. Trump to travel to Russia in conn ection with"
352,22,this proposal. I told Mr. Sater that Mr. Trump would not travel to Russia unless there was a
352,23,"definitive agreement in place."" 968 Third, although Cohen had regularly briefed Trump on the status"
352,24,"Trump Tower Moscow. The President's personal counsel declined and, through his own counsel, indicated"
352,25,that he could not disaggregate information he had obtained from Cohen from information he had obtained
352,26,from other parties in the IDA. In view of the admonition this Office gave to Cohen's counsel to withhold
352,27,"communications that could be covered by privilege, the President's personal counsel 's uncertainty about"
352,28,"the provenance of his own knowledge, the burden on a privilege holder to establish the elements to support"
352,29,"a claim of privilege, and the substance of the statements themselves, we have included relevant statements"
352,30,"Cohen provided in this report. If the statements were to be used in a context beyond this report, further"

365,4,"         In analyzing the President's conduct related to Cohen, the following evidence is relevant"
365,5,to the elements of obstruction of justice.
365,6,         a.      Obstructive act. We gathered evidence of the President ' s conduct related to Cohen
365,7,on two issues: (i) whether the President or others aided or participated in Cohen's false statements
365,8,"to Congress, and (ii) whether the President took actions that would have the natural tendency to"
365,9,prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to the government.
365,10,"                 i.       First , with regard to Cohen's false statements to Congress , while there is"
365,11,"evidence, described below , that the President knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress"
365,12,"about the Trump Tower Moscow project, the evidence available to us does not establish that the"
365,13,President directed or aided Cohen ' s false testimony.
365,14,"         Cohen said that his statements to Congress followed a ""party line"" that developed within"
365,15,the campaign to align with the President's public statements distancing the President from Russia.
365,16,"Cohen also recalled that , in speaking with the President in advance of testifying, he made it clear"
365,17,that he would stay on message-which Cohen believed they both understood would require false
365,18,testimony. But Cohen said that he and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen's
365,19,"testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did"
365,20,not direct him to provide false testimony. Cohen also said he did not tell the President about the
365,21,specifics of his planned testimony. During the time when his statement to Congress was being
365,22,"drafted and circulated to members of the JOA, Cohen did not speak directly to the President about"
365,23,"the statement, but rather communicated with the President's personal counsel-as corroborated by"
365,24,phone records showing extensive communications between Cohen and the President's personal
365,25,counsel before Cohen submitted his statement and when he testified before Congress.
365,26,"          Cohen recalled that in his discussions with the President's personal counsel on August 27,"
365,27,2017- the day before Cohen's statement was submitted to Congress - Cohen said that there were
365,28,more communications with Russia and more communications with candidate Trump than the
365,29,"statement reflected. Cohen recalled expressing some concern at that time. According to Cohen,"
365,30,the President's personal counsel-who            did not have first-hand knowledge of the project -
365,31,"responded by saying that there was no need to muddy the water , that it was unnecessary to include"
365,32,"those details because the project did not take place, and that Cohen should keep his statement short"
365,33,"and tight, not elaborate, stay on message, and not contradict the President. Cohen's recollection"
365,34,of the content of those conversations is consistent with direction about the substance of Cohen ' s
365,35,"draft statement that appeared to come from members of the JOA. For example , Cohen omitted"
365,36,any reference to his outreach to Russian government officials to set up a meeting between Trump
365,37,"and Putin during the United Nations General Assembly, and Cohen believed it was a decision of"
365,38, of conversations beyond that contained in the President's [written responses to the Special Counsel 's
365,39," Office]."" 2/6/19 Letter, President 's Personal Counsel to Special Counsel's Office."

366,5,         The President's personal counsel declined to provide us with his account of his
366,6,"conversations with Cohen, and there is no evidence available to us that indicates that the President"
366,7,was aware of the information Cohen provided to the President's personal counsel. The President's
366,8,"conversations with his personal counsel were presumptively protected by attorney-client privilege ,"
366,9,and we did not seek to obtain the contents of any such communications. The absence of evidence
366,10,about the President and his counsel's conversations about the drafting of Cohen ' s statement
366,11,"precludes us from assessing what, if any, role the President played."
366,12,"                  ii.    Second, we considered whether the President took actions that would have"
366,13,the natural tendency to prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to criminal
366,14,investigators or to Congress.
366,15,"          Before Cohen began to cooperate with the government, the President publicly and privately"
366,16,"urged Cohen to stay on message and not "" flip."" Cohen recalled the President's personal counsel"
366,17,"telling him that he would be protected so long as he did not go "" rogue. "" In the days and weeks"
366,18,"that fol lowed the Apri 12018 searches of Cohen ' s home and office, the President told reporters that"
366,19,"Cohen was a ""good man"" and said he was ""a fine person with a wonderful family ... who I have"
366,20,"always liked & respected."" Privately, the President told Cohen to ""hang in there"" and ""stay"
366,21,"strong."" People who were close to both Cohen and the President passed messages to Cohen that"
366,22,"""the President loves you,"" ""the boss loves you,"" and ""everyone knows the boss has your back ."""
366,23,"Through the President ' s personal counsel, the President also had previously told Cohen ""thanks"
366,24,"for what you do"" after Cohen provided information to the media about payments to women that ,"
366,25,"according to Cohen, both Cohen and the President knew was false. At that time , the Trump"
366,26,"Organization continued to pay Cohen's legal fees, which was important to Cohen. Cohen also"
366,27,"recalled discussing the possibility of a pardon with the President's personal counsel, who told him"
366,28,to stay on message and everything would be fine. Th e President indicated in his public statements
366,29,"that a pardon had not been ruled out , and also stated publicly that "" [m]ost people will flip if the"
366,30,"Government lets them out of trouble"" but that he ""d[idn 't] see Michael doing that. """
366,31,"          After it was reported that Cohen intended to cooperate with the government , however, the"
366,32,"President accused Cohen of ""mak[ing] up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam"
366,33," (Taxi cabs maybe?), "" called Cohen a ""rat,"" and on multiple occasions publicly suggested that"
366,34,Cohen's family members had committed crimes. The evidence concerning this sequence of events
366,35,could suppot1 an inference that the President used inducements in the form of positive messages
366,36," in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter the"
366,37, provision of information or undermine Cohen's credibility once Cohen began cooperating.

367,3,         c.      Intent. In analyzing the President's intent in his actions towards Cohen as a
367,4,"potential witness , there is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended to"
367,5,discourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen's information would shed
367,6,adverse light on the President's campaign-period conduct and statements.
367,7,                 i.      Cohen's false congressional testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow
367,8,project was designed to minimize connections between the President and Russia and to help limit
367,9,"the congressional and DOJ Russia investigations -a goal that was in the President's interest, as"
367,10,"reflected by the President's own statements. During and after the campaign, the President made"
367,11,"repeated statements that he had ""no business"" in Russia and said that there were ""no deals that"
367,12,"could happen in Russia, because we 've stayed away."" As Cohen knew , and as he recalled"
367,13,"communicating to the President during the campaign, Cohen ' s pursuit of the Trump Tower"
367,14,Moscow project cast doubt on the accuracy or completeness of these statements.
367,15,"         In connection with his guilty plea, Cohen admitted that he had multiple conversations with"
367,16,"candidate Trump to give him status updates about the Trump Tower Moscow project , that the"
367,17,"conversations continued through at least June 2016, and that he discussed with Trump possible"
367,18,"travel to Russia to pursue the project. The conversations were not off-hand, according to Cohen,"
367,19,"because the project had the potential to be so lucrative. In addition, text messages to and from"
367,20,Cohen and other records further establish that Cohen's efforts to advance the project did not end
367,21,"in January 2016 and that in May and June 2016, Cohen was considering the timing for possible"
367,22,trips to Russia by him and Trump in connection with the project.
367,23,         The evidence could support an inference that the President was aware of these facts at the
367,24,time of Cohen's false statements to Congress. Cohen discu ssed the project with the President in
367,25,"early 2017 following media inquiries. Cohen recalled that on September 20, 2017, the day after"
367,26,"he released to the public his opening remarks to Congress - which said the project ""was terminated"
367,27,"in January of 2016""-the President 's personal counsel told him the President was pleased with"
367,28,"what Cohen had said about Trump Tower Moscow. And after Cohen ' s guilty plea, the President"
367,29,"told reporters tha.t he had ultimately decided not to do the project , which supports the inference"
367,30,that he remained aware of his own involvement in the project and the period during the Campaign
367,31,in which the project was being pursued.
367,32,                  ii.    The President's public remarks following Cohen's guilty plea also suggest
367,33,that the President may have been concerned about what Cohen told investigators about the Trump
367,34,Tower Moscow project. At the time the President submitted written answers to questions from
367,35,"this Office about the project and other subjects , the media had reported that Cohen was cooperating"
367,36,with the government but Cohen had not yet pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress.
367,37,"Accordingly, it was not publicly known what information about the project Cohen had provided"
367,38,"to the government. In his written answers, the President did not provide details about the timing"
367,39,and substance of his discussions with Cohen about the project and gave no indication that he had
367,40,"decided to no longer pursue the project. Yet after Cohen pleaded guilty, the President publicly"
367,41, stated that he had personally made the decision to abandon the proje ct. The President then declined
367,42,to clarify the seeming discrepancy to our Office or answer additional questions. The content and
367,43,timing of the President's provision of information about his knowledge and actions regarding the
367,44, Trump Tower Moscow project is evidence that the President may have been concerned about the
367,45, information that Cohen could provide as a witness.

368,3,                  111.    The President's concern about Cohen cooperating may have been directed
368,4,at the Southern District of New York investigation into other aspects of the President's dealings
368,5,with Cohen rather than an investigation of Trump Tower Moscow . There also is some evidence
368,6,that the President's concern about Cohen cooperating was based on the President's stated belief
368,7,that Cohen would provide false testimony against the President in an attempt to obtain a lesser
368,8,"sentence for his unrelated criminal conduct. The President tweeted that Manafort, unlike Cohen ,"
368,9,"refused to ""break "" and ""make up stories in order to get a 'deal.""' And after Cohen pleaded guilty"
368,10,"to making false statements to Congress, the President said , ""what [Cohen]'s trying to do is get a"
368,11,"reduced sentence. So he's lying about a project that everybody knew about."" But the President"
368,12,"also appeared to defend the underlying conduct, saying , ""Even if [Cohen] was right, it doesn't"
368,13,"matter because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign."" As described above ,"
368,14,there is evidence that the President knew that Cohen had made false statements about the Trump
368,15,Tower Moscow project and that Cohen did so to protect the President and minimize the President ' s
368,16,connections to Russia during the campaign.
368,17,"                  iv.     Finally, the President's statements insinuating that members of Cohen 's"
368,18,family committed crimes after Cohen began cooperating with the government could be viewed as
368,19,an effort to retaliate against Cohen and chill further testimony adverse to the President by Cohen
368,20,"or others. It is possible that the President believes, as reflected in his tweets, that Cohen ""ma[d]e[]"
368,21,"up stories"" in order to get a deal for himself and ""g et his wife and father-in-law .. . off Scott Free."""
368,22,It also is possible that the President's mention of Cohen 's wife and father-in-law were not intended
368,23,to affect Cohen as a witness but rather were part of a public-relations strategy aimed at discr editing
368,24,Cohen and deflecting attention away from the President on Cohen-related matters. But the
368,25,"President's suggestion that Cohen 's family members committed crimes happened more than once ,"
368,26,including just before Cohen was sentenced (at the same time as the President stated that Cohen
368,27,"""should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence"") and again just befor e Cohen was"
368,28,scheduled to testify before Congress. The timing of the statements supports an inferenc e that they
368,29,were intended at least in part to discourage Cohen from further cooperation.
368,30,         L.       Overarching Factual Issues
368,31,         Although this report does not contain a traditional prosecution decision or declination
368,32,"decision, the evidence supports several general conclusions relevant to analysis of the facts"
368,33,concerning the President's course of conduct.
368,34,          1. Three features of this case render it atypical compared to the heartland obstruction -of-
368,35,justice prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice.
368,36,"         First, the conduct involved actions by the President. Some of the conduct did not implicate"
368,37,the President's constitutional authority and raises gar den-vari ety obstruction-of-justice issues.
368,38," Other events we investigated , howev er, drew upon the President's Article II authority, which"

368,40, of that conduct would have to take into account both that the President's acts were facially lawful
368,41, and that his position as head of th e Executive Branch provides him with unique and powerful
368,42," means of influencing official proceedings , subordinate officers, and potential witnesses."

369,3,"          Second, many obstruction cases involve the attempted or actual cover-up of an underlying"
369,4,crime. Personal criminal conduct can furnish strong evidence that the individual had an improper
369,5,"obstructive purpose, see, e.g., United States v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 24 (2d Cir. 1988), or that"
369,6,"he contemplated an effect on an official proceeding , see, e.g., United States v. Binday, 804 F.3d"
369,7," 558, 591 (2d Cir . 2015). But proof of such a crime is not an element of an obstruction offense."
369,8,"See United States v. Greer, 872 F.3d 790, 798 (6th Cir . 2017) (stating , in applying the obstruction"
369,9,"sentencing guideline, that ""obstruction of a criminal investigation is punishable even if the"
369,10,prosecution is ultimately unsuccessful or even if the investigation ultimately reveals no underlying
369,11,"crime""). Obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal"
369,12," interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area ,"
369,13,or to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same
369,14,regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.
369,15,"          In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an"
369,16,underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the evidence does point to a range
369,17,of other possible personal motives animating the President's conduct. These include concerns that
369,18,continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential
369,19,uncertainty about whether certain events-such          as advance notice of WikiLeaks ' s release of
369,20,"hacked information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians-"
369,21,"could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family."
369,22,"          Third , many of the President's acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of"
369,23,"cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons , occurred in public"
369,24,view. While it may be more difficult to establish that public-facing acts were motivated by a
369,25,"corrupt intent, the President's power to influence actions , persons, and events is enhanced by his"
369,26,unique ability to attract attention through use of mass communications . And no principle of law
369,27,excludes public acts from the scope of obstruction statutes. If the likely effect of the acts is to
369,28,"intimidate witnesses or alter their testimony , the justice system's integrity is equally threatened."
369,29,"          2. Although the events we investigated involved discrete acts- e.g., the President's"
369,30,"statement to Corney about the Flynn investigation , his termination of Corney, and his efforts to"
369,31,remove the Special Counsel - it is important to view the President ' s pattern of conduct as a whole.
369,32,That pattern sheds light on the nature of the President ' s acts and the inferences that can be drawn
369,33,about his intent.
369,34,          a. Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exetting
369,35,"undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and"
369,36,obstruction investigations. The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in
369,37,which the Presid ent sought to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions
369,38,ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effe ct of the Attorney
369,39,General ' s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to
369,40,direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony. Viewing
369,41,"the acts collectively can help to illuminate their significance. For example , the President ' s"
369,42,direction to McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed was followed almost immediat ely by
369,43,his direction to Lewandowski to tell the Attorney General to limit the scope of the Russia
369,44,inve stigation to prospective election-interference only-a temporal connection that suggests that
369,45,both acts were taken with a related purpose with respect to the investigation.

370,3,"         The President ' s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is"
370,4,largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede
370,5,"to his requests. Corney did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn's"
370,6,prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General
370,7,"that the Special Counsel must be removed , but was instead prepared to resign over the President's"
370,8,order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President ' s message to Sessions that he
370,9,should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to
370,10,recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President's direction to have the Special
370,11,"Counsel removed, despite the President's multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that"
370,12,"pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the"
370,13,President's aides and associates beyond those already filed.
370,14,"         b. In considering the full scope of the conduct we investigated, the President's actions can"
370,15,be divided into two distinct phases reflecting a possible shift in the President's motives. In the
370,16,"first phase , before the President fired Corney, the President had been assured that the FBI had not"
370,17,opened an investigation of him personally. The President deemed it critically important to make
370,18,"public that he was not under investigation, and he included that information in his termination"
370,19,letter to Corney after other efforts to have that information disclosed were unsuccessful.
370,20,"         Soon after he fired Corney, however, the President became aware that investigators were"
370,21,conducting an obstruction-of-justice inquiry into his own conduct. That awareness marked a
370,22,significant change in the President's conduct and the start of a second phase of action. The
370,23,President launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could
370,24,"possess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a series of"
370,25,"targeted efforts to control the investigation. For instance, the President attempted to remove the"
370,26,Special Counsel; he sought to have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit the
370,27,"investigation; he sought to prevent public disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 meeting"
370,28,between Russians and campaign officials; and he used public forums to attack potential witnesses
370,29,who might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who declined to cooperate with the
370,30,government. Judgments about the nature of the President's motiv es during each phase would be
370,31,informed by the totality of the evidence.

371,4,      THE PRESIDENT
371,5,         The President's personal counsel has written to this Office to advance statutory and
371,6,constitutional defenses to the potential application of the obstruction-of-justice statutes to the
371,7,"President's conduct. 1072 As a statutory matter , the President's counsel has argued that a core"
371,8,"obstruction-of-justice statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1512( c)(2) , does not cover the President ' s actions .1073"
371,9,"As a constitutional matter, the President ' s counsel argued that the President cannot obstruct justice"
371,10,by exercising his constitutional authority to close Department of Justice investigations or terminate
371,11,"the FBI Director. 1074 Under that view, any statute that restricts the President ' s exercise of those"
371,12,powers would impermissibly intrude on the President's constitutional role. The President 's
371,13,counsel has conceded that the President may be subject to criminal laws that do not directly involve
371,14,"exercises of his Article JI authority, such as laws prohibiting bribing witnesses or suborning"
371,15,"perjury. 1075 But counsel has made a categorical argument that ""the President's exercise of his"
371,16,constitutional authority here to terminate an FBI Director and to close investigations cannot
371,17,"constitutionally constitute obstruction of justice."" 1076"
371,18,"         In analyzing counsel 's statutory arguments, we concluded that the President's proposed"
371,19,interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2) is contrary to the litigating position of the Department of
371,20,Justice and is not supported by principles of statutory construction.
371,21,"         As for the constitutional arguments , we recogni zed that the Department of Justice and the"
371,22,courts have not definitively resolved these constitutional issues. We therefore analyzed the
371,23,President's position through the framework of Supreme Court precedent addressing the separation
371,24,"of powers. Under that framework, we concluded, Article IT of the Constitution does not"
371,25,categorically and permanently immunize the President from potential liability for the conduct that
371,26,"we investigated. Rather , our analysis led us to conclude that the obstruction-of-justice statutes can"

372,5,         A.       Statutory Defenses to the Application of Obstruction-Of-Justice Provisions to
372,6,                  the Conduct Under Investigation
372,7,         The obstruction-of-justice statute most readily applicable to our investigation is 18 U.S.C .
372,8,§ 1512( c)(2). Section I 512( c) provides:
372,9,         (c) Whoever corruptly-
372,10,"                  (!) alters, destroys , mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or"
372,11,"                  attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for"
372,12,                  use in an official proceeding; or
372,13,"                  (2) otherwise obstructs, influences , or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts"
372,14,"                  to do so,"
372,15,"         shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
372,16,"The Department of Justice has taken the position that Section 1512( c )(2) states a broad,"
372,17,"independent, and unqualified prohibition on obstruction of justice. 1077 While defendants have"
372,18,argued that subsection (c)(2) should be read to cover only acts that would impair the availability
372,19,"or integrity of evidence because that is subsection (c)(l)'s focus, strong arguments weigh against"
372,20,that proposed limitation. The text of Section 1512(c )(2) confirms that its sweep is not tethered to
372,21,Section 1512( c )(1 ); courts have so interpreted it; its history does not counsel otherwise; and no
372,22,"principle of statutory construction dictates a contrary view. On its face, therefore, Section"
372,23," 1512( c)(2) applies to all corrupt means of obstructing a proceeding, pending or contemplated-"
372,24,"including by improper exercises of official power. In addition, other statutory provisions that are"
372,25,potentially applicable to certain conduct we investigated broadly prohibit obstruction of
372,26,"proceedings that are pending before courts, grand juries, and Congress. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503,"
372,27, 1505. Congress has also specifically prohibited witness tampering. See 18 U .S.C. § 1512(6 ).
372,28,                   I. The Text of Section I 5 l 2{c){2) Prohibits a Broad Range of Obstructive Acts
372,29,         Several textual features of Section 1512( c)(2) support the conclusion that the provision
372,30,broadly prohibits corrupt means of obstructing justice and is not limited by the more specific
372,31,"prohibitions in Section 1512( c)(I), which focus on evidence impairment."
372,32,"         First, the text of Section 1512(c)(2) is unqualified: it reaches acts that ""obstruct[] ,"
372,33,"influence[], or impede[] any official proceeding"" when committed ""corruptly."" Nothing in Section"
372,34,1512(c)(2)'s text limits the provision to acts that would impair the integrity or availability of
372,35,"evidence for use in an official proceeding. In contrast, Section 1512(c)(I) explicitly includes the"
372,36,"requirement that the defendant act ""with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability"
372,37,         1077
372,38,"              See U.S. Br., United States v. Kumar, Nos. 06- 5482-cr(L), 06-5654-cr(CON) (2d Cir. filed"

373,4,"for use in an official proceeding,"" a requirement that Congress also included in two other sections"
373,5,of Section 1512. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1512(a)(2)(B)(ii) (use of physical force with intent to cause a
373,6,"person to destroy an object ""w ith intent to impair the integrity or availability of the object for use"
373,7,"in an official proceeding""); 1512(6)(2)(B) (use of intimidation, threats, corrupt persuasion , or"
373,8,"misleading conduct with intent to cause a person to destroy an object ""w ith intent to impair the"
373,9,"integrity or availability of the object for use in an official proceeding""). But no comparable intent"
373,10,or conduct element focused on evidence impairment appears in Section 1512(c)(2). The intent
373,11,"element in Section l 512(c)(2) comes from the word ""corruptly."" See, e.g., United .States v."
373,12,"McKibbins, 656 F.3d 707, 711 (7th Cir. 2011) (""The intent element is important because the word"
373,13,"' corruptly ' is what serves to separate criminal and innocent acts of obstruction."") (internal"
373,14,"quotation marks omitted). And the conduct element in Section 1512(c)(2) is ""obstruct[ing],"
373,15,"influenc[ing], or imped[ing]"" a proceeding. Congress is presumed to have acted intentionally in"
373,16,the disparate inclusion and exclusion of evidence-impairment language. See Loughrin v. United
373,17,"States, 573 U.S. 351, 358 (2014) (""[W]hen 'Congress includes particular language in one section"
373,18,of a statute but om its it in another' -let alone in the very next provision- th is Court ' presume[ s]'
373,19,"that Congress intended a difference in meaning"") (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16,"
373,20,"23 (1983)); accord Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers, 138 S. Ct. 767, 777(2018)."
373,21,"         Second, the structure of Section 1512 supports the conclusion that Section 1512(c)(2)"
373,22,defines an independent offense. Section 1512(c)(2) delineates a complete crime with different
373,23,elements from Section I 5 I 2(c)(I )-and each subsection of Section 1512(c) contains its own
373,24,"""attempt"" prohibition, underscoring that they are independent prohibitions. The two subsections"
373,25,"of Section 1512(c) are connected by the conjunction ""or,"" indicating that each provides an"
373,26,"alternative basis for criminal liability. See Loughrin , 573 U.S. at 357 (""ordinary use [of ' or '] is"
373,27,"almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to be given separate meanings"")"
373,28,"(internal quotation marks omitted). In Loughrin, for example, the Supreme Court relied on the use"
373,29,"of the word ""or"" to hold that adjacent and overlapping subsections of the bank fraud statute, 18"
373,30,"U .S.C. § 1344, state distinct offenses and that subsection 1344(2) therefore should not be"
373,31,interpreted to contain an additional element specified only in subsection 1344(1). Id.; see also
373,32,"Shaw v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 462, 465-469 (2016) (recognizing that the subsections of the"
373,33,"bank fraud statute ""overlap substantially"" but identifying distinct circumstances covered by"
373,34,"each). 1078 And here, as in Loughrin, Section 1512(c)'s ""two clauses have separate numbers, line"
373,35,"breaks before, between, and after them, and equivalent indentation-thus placing the clauses"
373,36,"visually on an equal footing and indicating that they have separate meanings."" 573 U.S. at 359."
373,37,"         Third, the introductory word ""otherwise"" in Section 1512(c)(2) signals that the provision"
373,38,covers obstructive acts that are different from those listed in Section 1512(c)(I). See Black's Law
373,39,"Dictionary 1101 (6th ed. 1990) (""otherwise"" means ""in a different manner; in another way, or in"

381,14,"         Before addressing Article II issues directly , we consider one threshold statutory -"
381,15,"construction principle that is unique to the presidency: ""The principle that general statutes must"

381,18,"Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C . 350, 352 (1995). This ""c lear"
381,19,"statement rule,"" id., has its source in two principles: statut es should be construed to avoid serious"
381,20,"constitutional questions , and Congress should not be assumed to have altered the constitutional"

381,23,         The Supreme Court has applied that clear-statement rule in several cases. In one leading
381,24,"case , the Court construed the Admini strative Procedure Act , 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., not to apply"
381,25,"to judicial review of pre sidential action. Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 800-801 (1992)."

382,4,"(discussing Franklin, Public Citizen , and Sale)."
382,5,        The Department of Justice has relied on this clear-statement principle to interpret certain
382,6,"statutes as not applying to the President at all, similar to the approach taken in Franklin. See, e.g.,"
382,7,"Memorandum for Richard T. Burress , Office of the President, from Laurence H. Silberman,"

382,11,does not apply to the President). Other OLC opinions interpret statutory text not to apply to certain
382,12,presidential or executive actions because of constitutional concerns. See Application of 28 U.S. C.
382,13,"§ 458 to Presidential Appoin tments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 350-357 (consanguinity"
382,14,"limitations on court appointments, 28 U.S.C. § 458, found inapplicable to ""presidential"

382,17,for certain lobbying programs found inapplicable to certain communications by the President and
382,18,executive officials).
382,19,"         But OLC has also recognized that this clear-statement rule ""does not apply with respect to"
382,20,"a statute that raises no separation of powers questions were it to be applied to the President,"" such"
382,21,"as the federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201. Application of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential"
382,22,"Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11. OLC explained that "" [a]pplication"
382,23,"of § 20 I raises no separation of powers question , let alone a serious one ,"" because [t]he"
382,24,"Constitution confers no power in the President to receive bribes."" Id. In support of that conclusion ,"
382,25,OLC noted constitutional provisions that forbid increases in the President's compensation while
382,26,"in office , ""which is what a bribe would function to do,"" id. (citing U.S. CONST.ART. II, § 1, cl. 7),"
382,27,"and the express constitutional power of ""Congress to impeach [and convict] a President for , inter"
382,28,"alia, bribery,"" id. (citing U.S. CONST.ARTII,§ 4)."
382,29,"         Under OLC's analysis, Congress can permissibly criminalize ce1tain obstructive conduct"
382,30,"by the President, such as suborning perjury , intimidating witnesses, or fabricating evidence ,"
382,31,because those prohibitions raise no separation-of-powers questions. See Application of 28 U.S.C.
382,32,"§ 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11. The"
382,33,"Constitution does not authorize the President to engage in such conduct, and those actions would"
382,34,"transgress the President's duty to ""take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. "" U.S . CONST."
382,35,"ART IT, §§ 3. In view of those clearly permissible applications of the obstruction statutes to the"
382,36,"President, Franklin's holding that the President is entirely excluded from a statute absent a clear"
382,37,statement would not apply in this context.
382,38,         A more limited application of a clear-statement rule to exclude from the obstruction statutes
382,39,"only certain acts by the President - for example, removing prosecutors or ending investigations"
382,40,for corrupt reasons - would be difficult to implement as a matter of statutory interpretation. It is
382,41,not obvious how a clear-statement rule would apply to an omnibus provision like Section
382,42, 1512( c)(2) to exclude corruptly motivated obstructive acts only when carried out in the President ' s
382,43,"conduct of office. No statutory term could easily bear that specialized meaning. For example, the"

384,19,"Executive officers, a power [that] ... is not conferred by any explicit provision in the text of the"

384,22," United States, 272 U.S. 52, 115-116 ( 1926)). Consistent with that statement , Morrison sustained"
384,23, a good-cause limitation on the removal of an inferior officer with defined prosecutorial

384,25,"President's ability to perform his Article II functions. 487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696 . The Court"
384,26," has also evaluated other general executive-power claims through a balancing test. For example,"
384,27, the Court evaluated the President's claim of an absolute privilege for presidential communications
384,28, about his official acts by balancing that interest against the Judicial Branch's need for evidence in
384,29," a criminal case. United States v. Nixon, supra (recognizing a qualified constitutional privilege for"
384,30, presidential communications on official matters). The Court has also upheld a law that provided

384,32," the records. Administrator of General Services , 433 U.S. at 443-445, 451-455. The analysis in"
384,33, those cases supports applying a balancing test to assess the constitutionality of applying the
384,34, obstruction-of-justice statutes to presid ential exercises of executive power .
384,35,         Only in a few instances has the Court applied a different framework. When the President's

384,37," its exercise. Zivotofsky v. Kerry , I 35 S. Ct. 2076, 2084 (2015). In Zivotofsky , for example, the"

385,23,                           b. The Effect of Obstruction-of-Justice Statutes on the President's
385,24,                               Capacity to Perform His Article II Responsibilities is Limited
385,25,"          Under the Supreme Court's balancing test for analyzing separation-of-power s issues , the"
385,26,first task is to assess the degree to which applying ob struction-of-justice statutes to presidential
385,27,actions affects the President ' s ability to carry out his Article II responsibilitie s. Administrator of
385,28,"General Services , 433 U.S. at 443. As discu ssed above , applying obstruction -of-ju stice statutes"
385,29,to presidential conduct that does not involve the Presid ent's conduct of office-such as influencing
385,30,the testimony of witnesses-is constitutionally unproblematic. The President has no more right
385,31,than other citize ns to impede official proceedings by corruptl y influencing witness testimon y. The
385,32,conduct would be equall y improper whether effe ctuated through direct efforts to produce false
385,33,"testimony or suppress the truth , or through the actual , threatened , or promised use of official"
385,34,powers to achieve the same result.
385,35,"          Th e President 's action in curtailing criminal investigations or prosecutions, or discharging"
385,36,"law enforcement officials, raises different questions. Each type of action involves the exercise of"
385,37,"executive discretion in furtherance of the President's duty to ""t ake Care that the Laws be faithfull y"
385,38,"executed. "" U.S. CONST., ART. II, § 3. Congre ss may not supplant the Pre sident's exer cise of"
385,39,executive power to supervise prosecutions or to remov e officer s who occupy law enforc ement
385,40,"positions. See Bowsher v. Synar , 478 U.S. 714 , 726-727 (1986) (""Con gress cannot reserve for"
385,41,itself the pow er of removal of an offic er charged with the execution of the laws except by

386,3,"only when it is taken with the ""corrupt "" intent to obstruct justice. The obstruction statutes thus"
386,4,would restrict presidential action only by prohibiting the President from acting to obstruct official
386,5,"proceedings for the improper purpose of protecting his own interests. See Volume IT, Section"
386,6,"TII.A.3, supra."
386,7,         The direct effect on the President ' s freedom of action would correspondingly be a limited
386,8,"one. A preclusion of ""corrupt"" official action is not a major intrusion on Article II powers. For"
386,9,"example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the President to act"
386,10,"with the intention of sh ielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding financial liability , or"
386,11,"preventing personal embarrassment.         To the contrary, a statute that prohibits official action"
386,12,"undertaken for such personal purposes furthers , rather than hinders, the impartial and eve nhanded"
386,13,administration of the law. And the Constitution does not mandate that the President have
386,14,"unfettered authority to direct investigations or prosecutions , with no limits whatsoever, in order to"
386,15,"carry out his Article II functions. See Heckler v. Chaney, 4 70 U.S. 821 , 833 ( 1985) (""Congress"
386,16,"may limit an agency ' s exercise of enforcement power if it wishes, either by setting substantive"
386,17,"priorities , or by otherwise circumscribing an agency ' s power to discriminate among issues or cases"
386,18,"it will pursue.""); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S . at 707 ("" [t]o read the Art. II powers of the"
386,19,President as providing an absolute privilege [to withhold confidential communications from a
386,20,criminal trial] . .. would upset the constitutional balance of 'a workable government ' and gravely
386,21,"impair the role of the courts under Art. III"")."
386,22,         Nor must the President have unfettered authority to remove all Executive Branch officials
386,23,involved in the execution of the laws. The Constitution establishes that Congress has legislative
386,24,authority to structure the Executive Branch by authorizing Congress to create executive
386,25,"departm ents and officer positions and to specify how inferior officers are appointed . E.g., U.S."
386,26,"CONST., ART. I, § 8, cl. 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause); ART. II, § 2, cl. 1 (Opinions Clause);"
386,27,"ART. TI, § 2, cl. 2 (Appointments Clause); see Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 499. While the"
386,28,President ' s removal power is an important means of ensuring that officers faithfully execute the
386,29,"law, Congress has a recognized authority to place certain limits on removal. Id. at 493-495."
386,30,         The President's removal powers are at their zenith with respect to principal officers-that
386,31,"is, officers who must be appointed by the President and who report to him directly. See Free"
386,32,"Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 493, 500 . The President's ""exclusive and illimitable power of"
386,33,"removal"" of those principal officers furthers ""the President's ability to ensure that the laws are"
386,34,"faithfully executed. "" Id. at 493, 498 (internal quotation marks omitted); Myers, 272 U.S. at 627."
386,35,"Thus, ""there are some ' purely executive' officials who must be removable by the President at will"
386,36,"if he is able to accomplish his constitutional role. "" Morrison, 487 U.S. at 690; Myers, 272 U.S. at"
386,37,"134 (the President ' s ""cabinet officers must do his will, "" and "" [t]he moment that he loses confidence"
386,38,"in the intelligence , ability, judgment , or loyalty of any one of them, he must have the power to"
386,39,"remove him without delay""); cf Humphr ey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935)"
386,40,(Congress has the power to create independent agencies headed by principal officers removable
386,41,"only for good cause). In light of those constitutional precedents, it may be that the obstruction"
386,42,statutes could not be constitutionally applied to limit the removal of a cabinet officer such as the
386,43,"Attorney General. See 5 U.S.C. § 101; 28 U.S.C. § 503. In that context, at least absent"

387,18,495 (citing Perkins and Morrison). The category of inferior officers includes both the FBI Director
387,19,"and the Special Counsel, each of whom reports to the Attorney General. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 509,"
387,20,"5 I 5(a), 531; 28 C.F .R. Part 600. Their work is thus ""directed and supervised"" by a presidentially-"

387,23,for constitutional purposes).
387,24,          Where the Constitution permits Congress to impose a good-cause limitation on the removal
387,25,"of an Executive Branch officer, the Constitution should equally permit Congress to bar removal"
387,26,"for the corrupt purpose of obstructing justice. Limiting the, range of permissible reasons for"
387,27,"removal to exclude a ""corrupt"" purpose imposes a lesser restraint on the President than requiring"
387,28,"an affirmative showing of good cause. It follows that for such inferior officers, Congress may"
387,29,constitutionally restrict the President's removal authority if that authority was exercised for the
387,30,corrupt purpose of obstructing justice. And even if a particular inferior officer's position might be
387,31,of such importance to the execution of the laws that the President must have at-will removal
387,32,"authority, the obstruction-of-justice statutes could still be constitutionally applied to forbid"
387,33,removal for a corrupt reason. 1088 A narrow and discrete limitation on removal that precluded
387,34,"corrupt action would leave ample room for all other considerations , including disagreement over"
387,35,policy or loss of confidence in the officer's judgment or commitment. A corrupt-purpose
387,36,prohibition therefore would not undermine the President' s ability to perform his Article II
387,37,"functions. Accordingly, because the separation-of-powers question is ""whether the removal"
387,38,restrictions are of such a nature that they impede the President ' s ability to perform his
387,39,"constitutional duty,"" Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691, a restriction on removing an inferior officer for a"

388,12,"Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443. Here, Congress enacted the obstruction-of -"

388,15, serve strong governmental interests.
388,16,          i. Congress has Article I authority to define generally applicable criminal law and apply it
388,17, to all persons-including         the President.       Congress clearly has authority to protect its own
388,18, legislative functions against corrupt efforts designed to impede legitimate fact -gathering and
388,19," lawmaking efforts . See Watkins v. United States , 354 U.S. 178, 187, 206-207 (1957); Chapman"
388,20," v. United States, 5 App. D.C. 122, 130 ( 1895). Congress also has authority to establish a system"
388,21," of federal courts , which includes the power to protect the judiciary against obstructive acts . See"
388,22," U.S. CONST. ART. I, § 8, els. 9, 18 (""The Congress shall have Power ... To constitute Tribunals"
388,23," inferior to the supreme Court"" and ""To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for"
388,24," carrying into Execution the foregoing powers""). The long lineage of the obstruction-of-justice"
388,25," statutes, which can be traced to at least 183 I , attests to the necessity for that protection. See An"
388,26,"Act Declaratory of the Law Concerning Contempts of Court, 4 Stat. 487-488 § 2 (1831) (making"

388,31,          ii. The Article TII courts have an equally strong interest in being protected against
388,32," obstructive acts, whatever their source. As the Supreme Court explained in United States v. Nixon,"
388,33," a ""primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch"" is ""to do justice in criminal prosecutions. """

388,38,                The obstruction statutes do not disqualify the President from acting in a case simply because
388,39, he has a personal interest in it or because his own conduct may be at issue. As the Department of Justice
388,40," has made clear, a claim of a conflict of interest, standing alone, cannot deprive the President of the ability"
388,41," to fulfill his constitutional function. See, e.g., OLC, Application of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential"

389,8,"         iii. Finally, the grand jury cannot achieve its constitutional purpose absent protection from"
389,9,corrupt acts . Serious federal criminal charges generally reach the Article III courts based on an

389,18,"If the grand jury were not protected against corrupt interference from all per sons , its function as"
389,19,an independent charging body would be thwarted. And an impartial grand jury investigation to

389,22,         The final step in the constitutional balancing process is to assess whether the separation-
389,23,of-powers doctrine permits Congress to take action within its constitutional authority
389,24,notwithstanding the potential impact on Article II functions. See Administrator of General
389,25,"Services, 433 U.S. at 443 ; see also Morrison, 487 U.S . at 691-693 , 695-696; United States v. Nixon,"
389,26,"418 U.S. at 711-712. In the case of the obstruction-of-justice statutes, our assessment of the"
389,27,weighing of interests leads us to conclude that Congress has the authority to impose the limited
389,28,restrictions contained in those statutes on the President 's official conduct to protect the integrity
389,29,of important functions of other branches of government.
389,30,         A general ban on corrupt action doe s not unduly intrude on the President 's responsibility
389,31,"to ""ta ke Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."" U.S. CONST.ART IT, §§ 3. 1090 To the contrary,"
389,32,"the concept of ""faithful execution"" connotes the use of power in the interest of the public, not in"
389,33,"the office holder's personal interests. See 1 Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of the English"
389,34,"Language 763 (1755) (""faithfully"" def. 3: "" [w]ith strict adherence to duty and allegiance""). And"
389,35,immunizing the President from the generally applicable criminal prohibition against corrup t

390,3,"          Accordingly, based on the analysis above, we were not persuaded by the argument that the"

390,5,justice through the exercise of otherwise-valid Article TI powers. 1091
390,6,                   3. Ascertaining Whether the President Violated the Obstruction Statutes Would
390,7,                       Not Chill his Performance of his Article II Duties
390,8,          Applying the obstruction statutes to the President ' s official conduct would involve
390,9,"determining as a factual matter whether he engaged in an obstructive act , whether the act had a"
390,10,"nexus to official proceedings, and whether he was motivated by corrupt intent. But applying those"
390,11,standards to the President's official conduct should not hinder his ability to perform his Article II
390,12,"duties. Cf Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S . at 752- 753 & n.32 (taking into account chilling effect on"
390,13,the President in adopting a constitutional rule of presid ential immunity from private civil damages
390,14,action based on official duties). Several safeguards would prevent a chilling effect: the existence
390,15,"of settled legal standards, the presumption of regularity in prosecutorial actions , and the existence"
390,16,of evidentiary limitations on probing the President's motives. And historical experience confirms
390,17,that no impermissible chill should exist.
390,18,"          a. As an initial matter , the term ""corruptly"" sets a demanding standard. It requires a"
390,19," concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to obtain an "" improper advantage for [him]self"
390,20," or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others."" BALLENTINE'SLAW"
390,21,"DICTIONARY276 (3d ed. 1969); see United States v. Pasha, 797 F .3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir.2015);"
390,22,"Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That standard"
390,23, parallels the President 's constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws. And
390,24,virtually everything that the President does in the routine conduct of office will have a clear
390,25," governmental purpose and will not be contrary to his official duty. Accordingly, the President has"
390,26," no reason to be chilled in those actions because, in virtually all instances , there will be no credible"
390,27, basis for suspecting a corrupt personal motive.
390,28,          That point is illustrated by examples of conduct that would and would not satisfy the
390,29, stringent corrupt-motive standard. Direct or indirect action by the President to end a criminal
390,30, invest igation into his own or his family members' conduct to protect against personal
390,31, embarrassment or legal liability would constitute a core example of corruptly motivated conduct.
390,32, So too would action to halt an enforcement proceeding that directly and adversely affected the

390,34,          1091
390,35,               A possible remedy through impeachment for abuses of power would not substitute for potential
390,36," criminal liability after a President leaves office. Impeachment would remove a President from office, but"
390,37, would not address the underlying culpability of the conduct or serve the usual purposes of the criminal law.
390,38," Indeed, the Impeachment Judgment Clause recognizes that criminal law plays an independent role in"

390,40," l, § 3, cl. 7. Impeachment is also a drastic and rarely invoked remedy, and Congress is not restricted to"
390,41," relying only on impeachment, rather than making criminal law applicable to a former President, as OLC"

391,5,The President's role as head of the government necessarily requires him to take into account
391,6,political factors in making policy decisions that affect law-enforcement actions and proceedings.
391,7,"For instance, the President 's decision to curtail a law-enforcement investigation to avoid"
391,8,international friction would not implicate the obstruction-of-justice statutes. The criminal law
391,9,does not seek to regulate the consideration of such political or policy factors in the conduct of
391,10,"government. And when legitimate interests animate the President 's conduct, those interests will"
391,11,almost invariably be readil y identifiable based on objective factors. Because the President ' s
391,12,"conduct in those instances will obviously fall outside the zone of obstruction law, no chilling"
391,13,concern should arise.
391,14,"         b. There is also no reason to believe that investigation s, let alone prosecutions, would"
391,15,occur except in highly unusual circumstances when a credible factual basis exists to be lieve that
391,16,"obstruction occurred. Prosecuto ria l action enjoys a presumption of regularity: absent ""clea r"
391,17,"evidence to the contrary , courts presume that [prosecutors] have properly discharged their official"

391,19,"U.S . I, 14-15 (1926)). The presumption of prosecutorial regularity would provide even greater"
391,20,protection to the President than exists in routine cases given the prominence and sensitivity of any
391,21,matter involving the President and the likelihood that such matters will be subject to thorough and
391,22,careful review at the most senior levels of the Department of Justice. Under OLC's opinion that a
391,23,"sitting President is entitled to immunity from indictment, only a successor Administration would"
391,24,be able to prosecute a former President. But that consideration does not suggest that a President
391,25,would have any basis for fearing abusive investigations or prosecutions after leavin g office. There
391,26,"are ""obv ious political checks"" against initiating a baseless inv est igation or prosecution of a former"
391,27,"President. See Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 448 (considering political checks"

391,30,"(citing 28 U.S.C. § 516), which provides a strong institutional safeguard against politicized"
391,31,investigations or prosecutions . 1092
391,32,          1092
391,33,               Similar institutional safeguards protect Department of Justice officers and line prosecutors
391,34,against unfounded investigations into prosecutorial acts. Prosecutors are generally barred from
391,35,"participating in matters implicating their personal interests, see 28 C.F.R. § 45.2, and are instructed not to"
391,36,"be influenced by their ""own professional or personal circumstances,"" Justice Manual § 9-27.260, so"
391,37,prosecutors would not frequently be in a position to take action that could be perceived as corrupt and
391,38,"personally motivated. And if such cases arise, criminal investigation would be conducted by responsible"
391,39,"officials at the Department of Justice, who can be presumed to refrain from pursuing an investigation absent"
391,40,a credible factual basis. Those facts distinguish the criminal context from the common-law rule of
391,41,"prosecutorial immunity, which protects against the threat of suit by ""a defendant [who] often will transform"
391,42,"his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions."" Imbler v."
391,43,"Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409,425 (1976). As the Supreme Court has noted, the existence of civil immunity"

392,4,"         These considerations distinguish the Supreme Court's holding in Nixon v. Fitzgerald that,"

392,6,absolutely immune from private civil damages actions based on his official conduct. 457 U.S. at

392,11,517 U.S. at 464.
392,12,         c. In the rare cases in which a substantial and credible basis justifies conducting an
392,13,"investigation of the President, the process of examining his motivations to determine whether he"
392,14,acted for a corrupt purpose need not have a chilling effect. Ascertaining the President's
392,15,"motivations would turn on any explanation he provided to justify his actions, the advice he"
392,16,"received, the circumstances surrounding the actions, and the regularity or irregularity of the"
392,17,process he employed to make decisions. But grand juries and courts would not have automatic
392,18,"access to confidential presidential communications on those matters; rather, they could be"
392,19,"presented in official proceedings only on a showing of sufficient need. Nixon, 418 U.S . at 712; In"

392,21,"Services, 433 U.S. at 448-449 (former President can invoke presidential communications privilege,"
392,22,"although successor's failure to support the claim ""detracts from [its] weight"")."
392,23,"         In any event, probing the President's intent in a criminal matter is unquestionably"
392,24,constitutional in at least one context: the offense of bribery turns on the corrupt intent to receive
392,25,a thing of value in return for being influenced in official action. 18 U.S.C. § 20l(b)(2). There can
392,26,"be no serious argument against the President's potential criminal liability for bribery offenses ,"
392,27,"notwithstanding the need to ascertain his purpose and intent. See U.S. CONST.ART. I, § 3; ART. IT,"
392,28,"§ 4; see also Application of 28 US. C. § 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19"

392,30,"issue, let alone a serious one ."")."
392,31,"         d. Finally, history provides no reason to believe that any asserted chilling effect justifies"
392,32,"exempting the President from the obstruction laws. As a historical matter , Presidents have very"
392,33,seldom been the subjects of grand jury investigations. And it is rarer still for circumstances to
392,34,raise even the possibility of a corrupt personal motive for arguably obstructive action through the
392,35,"President's use of official power. Accordingly, the President's conduct of office should not be"
392,36,chilled based on hypothetical concerns about the possible application of a corrupt -motive standard
392,37,in this context.

417,5,          The President provided written responses through his personal counsel to questions
417,6,submitted to him by the Special Counsel 's Office. We first explain the process that led to the
417,7,submission of written questions and then attach the President ' s responses.
417,8,"          Beginning in Dec ember 2017, this Office sought for more than a year to interview the"
417,9,President on topics relevant to both Russian-election interference and obstruction-of-justice . We
417,10,"advised counsel that the President was a "" subject"" of the investigation unde r the definition of the"
417,11,"Justice Manual -"" a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury's investigation. """
417,12,"Justice Manual § 9-11.151 (2018). We also advised counsel that""[ a]n interview with the President"
417,13,"is vital to our investigation"" and that this Office had "" carefull y considered the constitutional and"
417,14,"other arguments raised by . .. counsel , and they d[id] not provide us with reason to forgo seeking"
417,15,"an interview ."" 1 We additionally stated that ""it is in the interest of the Presidency and the public"
417,16,"for an interview to take place"" and offered ""numerous accommodations to aid the President 's"
417,17,"preparation and avoid surprise."" 2 After extensive discussions with the Department of Justice about"
417,18,"the Special Counsel's objective of securing the President's testimon y, thes e accommodations"
417,19,included the submissions of written questions to the Presid ent on certain Russia-related topics. 3
417,20,"          We received the President's written responses in late November 2018. 4 In December 2018 ,"
417,21,"we informed counsel of the insufficiency of those responses in several respect s. 5 We noted, among"
417,22,"other things , that the President stated on more than 30 occasions that he ""does not 're call ' or"
417,23,"' remember ' or have an ' independent recollection""' of information called for by the questions. 6"

429,13,Kushner was considering participating in a meeting in June 2016 concerning potentially negative
429,14,"information about Hillary Clinton. Nor do I recall learning during the campaign that the June 9,"

429,19, I have no independent recollection of what portion of these four days in June of2016 I spent in

429,22, I am now aware that my Campaign's calendar indicates that I was in New York City from June 6
429,23," - 9, 2016. Calendars kept in my Trump Tower office reflect that I had various calls and meetings"
429,24, scheduled for each of these days. While those calls and meetings may or may not actually have
429,25," taken place, they do indicate that I was in Trump Tower during a portion of each of these working"
429,26," days, and I have no reason to doubt that I was. When I was in New York City, I stayed at my"
429,27, Trump Tower apartment.
429,28, My Trump Organization desk calendar also reflects that I was outside Trump Tower during
429,29," portions of these days. The June 7, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to leave Trump Tower"
429,30,"  in the early evening for Westchester where I gave remarks after winning the California, New"
429,31," Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota Republican primaries held that day. The June 8,"
